TI  - Depression, patient characteristics, and attachment style: correlates and mediators of medication treatment adherence in a racially diverse primary care sample.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The depth and breadth of problems related to depressive symptomatology and optimal treatment outcomes, including medication treatment adherence, have long been documented in the literature. Missing are clear explanations as to what factors and patient characteristics may account for lack of medication treatment adherence.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The two objectives of the current study were to examine the predictive strength of depression, patient characteristics, and patient attachment style regarding medication treatment adherence and to consider the extent to which attachment styles mediate the relation between depression and medication treatment adherence.
AB  - METHOD: Participants in the present study were 237 racially diverse American primary care patients with a diagnosis of hypertension who were participants in a clinical trial. Depression, patient characteristics, attachment style, and medication treatment adherence were assessed.
AB  - RESULTS: Partly consistent with our four hypotheses, the following results were found: (a) Black American, younger, never married, and poorer patients had lower medication treatment adherence (b) depression was significantly associated with lower self-reported medication adherence; (c) insecure-dismissing attachment style was related to lower medication adherence; and (d) insecure-dismissing attachment style mediates the relation between depression and medication treatment adherence by exacerbating the negative association.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Physicians and other primary care providers should consider how depressive symptomatology, patient characteristics, and attachment style may inform the treatment plans they put forward and the extent to which patients may adhere to those treatment plans.

TI  - Risks associated with permanent discontinuation of blood pressure-lowering medications in patients with type 2 diabetes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The associations of discontinuation of the study medication on major outcomes were assessed in the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation Trial.
AB  - METHODS: ADVANCE was a factorial randomized controlled trial of blood pressure lowering (a fixed combination of perindopril and indapamide vs. placebo) and intensive glucose control (vs. standard glucose control) in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients who permanently discontinued the randomized blood pressure-lowering medication during the study period (n = 1557) were compared with others (n = 9583). Cox's proportional hazards models were used to estimate the effects of the discontinuation on the risks of macrovascular events, microvascular events together and separately and all-cause mortality, using discontinuation as a time-dependent covariate.
AB  - RESULTS: In multivariable analyses, discontinuation was associated with increased risks of combined macro and microvascular events (hazard ratio 2.24, 95% CI 1.96-2.57), macrovascular events (3.23, 2.75-3.79), microvascular events (1.38, 1.11-1.71), and all-cause mortality (7.99, 6.92-9.21) compared to continuing administration of randomized medications during the trial period, which were highest in the first year after discontinuation. These associations were similar in active and placebo groups, except in the first year after discontinuation during which event rates were lower in the active group than in the placebo group (P < 0.01).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Discontinuation of study medication is a potent risk marker for identifying high-risk patients. Thus it is important that clinicians seek to identify such patients early after discontinuation of treatment. Although some short-term residual effects of previous active treatment can be expected, patients who discontinue require further urgent investigation and management.

AU  - Missed Dose Study Group
TI  - Comparative study of the efficacy of olmesartan/amlodipine vs. perindopril/amlodipine in peripheral blood pressure after missed dose in type 2 diabetes.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Combination therapy is needed to control blood pressure (BP) in a large number of hypertensive patients with diabetes mellitus. Adherence to treatment is a major clinical problem; therefore, the time duration of the antihypertensive action of a drug determines BP control when a dose is skipped.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim was to determine whether the fixed-dose combination of olmesartan/amlodipine provides equal efficacy and safety as the perindopril/amlodipine combination when a drug dose is missed.
AB  - METHODS: In this noninferiority trial with a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy parallel group, controlled design, 260 patients received either olmesartan 20-40 mg/amlodipine 5-10 mg or perindopril 4-8 mg/amlodipine 5-10 mg for 24 weeks. The main outcome was the sitting office DBP after 24 weeks of treatment at 48 h from last administration.
AB  - RESULTS: The olmesartan/amlodipine combination reached noninferiority criteria in reduction of office DBP after 24 weeks of treatment and after the missed dose, compared with the perindopril/amlodipine combination (-11.7 and -10.5 mmHg, respectively). Office SBP and pulse pressure were significantly lower in both groups after 24 weeks of treatment and 48 h after the missed dose, observing a trend to greater SBP reduction in the olmesartan/amlodipine group.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The combination olmesartan/amlodipine is safe, well tolerated, and as effective as the combination of perindopril/amlodipine in the control of essential hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus. A missed dose does not leave the patients unprotected in both treatments; however, a faster control with less dose increment is observed with olmesartan/amlodipine.

TI  - Brief provider communication skills training fails to impact patient hypertension outcomes.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Hypertension remains a prevalent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and improved medication adherence leads to better blood pressure (BP) control. We sought to improve medication adherence and hypertension outcomes among patients with uncontrolled BP through communication skills training targeting providers.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of a communication skills intervention for primary care doctors compared to usual care controls, on the outcomes of BP (systolic, diastolic), patient self-reported medication adherence, and provider counseling, assessed at baseline and post-intervention. We enrolled 379 patients with uncontrolled BP; 203 (54%) with follow-up data comprised our final sample. We performed random effects least squares regression analyses to examine whether the provider training improved outcomes, using clinics as the unit of randomization.
AB  - RESULTS: In neither unadjusted nor multivariate analyses were significant differences in change detected from baseline to follow-up in provider counseling, medication adherence or BP, for the intervention versus control groups.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The intervention did not improve the outcomes; it may have been too brief and lacked sufficient practice level changes to impact counseling, adherence or BP.
AB  - PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Future intervention efforts may require more extensive provider training, along with broader systematic changes, to improve patient outcomes.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Medication adherence and visit-to-visit variability of systolic blood pressure in African Americans with chronic kidney disease in the AASK trial.
AB  - Lower adherence to antihypertensive medications may increase visit-to-visit variability of blood pressure (VVV of BP), a risk factor for cardiovascular events and death. We used data from the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) trial to examine whether lower medication adherence is associated with higher systolic VVV of BP in African Americans with hypertensive chronic kidney disease (CKD). Determinants of VVV of BP were also explored. AASK participants (n=988) were categorized by self-report or pill count as having perfect (100%), moderately high (75-99%), moderately low (50-74%) or low (<50%) proportion of study visits with high medication adherence over a 1-year follow-up period. We used multinomial logistic regression to examine determinants of medication adherence, and multivariable-adjusted linear regression to examine the association between medication adherence and systolic VVV of BP, defined as the coefficient of variation or the average real variability (ARV). Participants with lower self-reported adherence were generally younger and had a higher prevalence of comorbid conditions. Compared with perfect adherence, moderately high, moderately low and low adherence was associated with 0.65% (+/-0.31%), 0.99% (+/-0.31%) and 1.29% (+/-0.32%) higher systolic VVV of BP (defined as the coefficient of variation) in fully adjusted models. Results were qualitatively similar when using ARV or when using pill counts as the measure of adherence. Lower medication adherence is associated with higher systolic VVV of BP in African Americans with hypertensive CKD; efforts to improve medication adherence in this population may reduce systolic VVV of BP.

TI  - Case Study: Community Engagement and Clinical Trial Success: Outreach to African American Women.
AB  - This brief report examines how the use of community engagement principles and approaches enhanced clinical trial recruitment and retention. The Community-Engaged Research Core (CERC), a CTSA-supported resource designed to facilitate community involvement in clinical and translational research, was consulted to provide assistance with the implementation of the clinical trial, and specifically to enhance participation of the target population-African American women. CERC's key recommendations included: (1) convene a Community Engagement Studio, (2) redesign the recruitment advertisement, (3) simplify the language used to explain the scope of the study, and (4) provide transportation for participants. As a result of these interventions, a comprehensive strategy to recruit, enroll, and retain participants was formulated. After implementation of the plan by the study team, enrollment increased 78% and recruitment goals were met 16 months ahead of schedule. Participant retention and study drug adherence was 100%. We conclude that community engagement is essential to the development of an effective multifaceted plan to improve recruitment of underrepresented groups in clinical trials.

TI  - An analysis of the blood pressure and safety outcomes to renal denervation in African Americans and Non-African Americans in the SYMPLICITY HTN-3 trial.
AB  - SYMPLICITY HTN-3, the first trial of renal denervation (RDN) versus sham, enrolled 26% African Americans, a prospectively stratified cohort. Although the 6-month systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduction in African Americans (AAs) was similar in the RDN group (-15.5 +/- 25.4 mm Hg, n = 85 vs. -17.8 +/- 29.2, n = 49, P = .641), the sham SBP response was 9.2 mm Hg greater (P = .057) in AAs than non-AAs. In multivariate analyses, sham SBP response was predicted by an interaction between AA and a complex antihypertensive regimen (at least one antihypertensive medication prescribed >3 times daily), while in the RDN group, SBP response was predicted by an interaction between AA race and baseline BP > 180 mm Hg. AA race did not independently predict SBP response in either sham or RDN. There appears to be effect modification by race with individual-level patient characteristics in both treatment arms that affect the observed pattern of SBP responses.Copyright © 2015 American Society of Hypertension.

TI  - Positive airway pressure improves nocturnal beat-to-beat blood pressure surges in obesity hypoventilation syndrome with obstructive sleep apnea.
AB  - Positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment has been shown to have a modest effect on ambulatory blood pressure (BP) in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, there is a paucity of data on the effect of PAP therapy on rapid, yet significant, BP swings during sleep, particularly in obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). The present study hypothesizes that PAP therapy will improve nocturnal BP on the first treatment night (titration PAP) in OHS patients with underlying OSA, and that these improvements will become more significant with 6 wk of PAP therapy. Seventeen adults (7 men, 10 women; age 50.4 +/- 10.7 years, BMI 49.3 +/- 2.4 kg/m(2)) with OHS and clinically diagnosed OSA participated in three overnight laboratory visits that included polysomnography and beat-to-beat BP monitoring via finger plethysmography. Six weeks of PAP therapy, but not titration PAP, lowered mean nocturnal BP. In contrast, when nocturnal beat-to-beat BPs were aggregated into bins consisting of at least three consecutive cardiac cycles with a >10 mmHg BP surge (i.e., DELTA10-20, DELTA20-30, DELTA30-40, and DELTA>40 mmHg), titration, and 6-wk PAP reduced the number of BP surges per hour (time x bin, P < 0.05). PAP adherence over the 6-wk period was significantly correlated to reductions in nocturnal systolic (r = 0.713, P = 0.001) and diastolic (r = 0.497, P = 0.043) BP surges. Despite these PAP-induced improvements in nocturnal beat-to-beat BP surges, 6 wk of PAP therapy did not alter daytime BP. In conclusion, PAP treatment reduces nocturnal beat-to-beat BP surges in OHS patients with underlying OSA, and this improvement in nocturnal BP regulation was greater in patients with higher PAP adherence.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.

TI  - Multifaceted Prospective Memory Intervention to Improve Medication Adherence.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To test whether a multifaceted prospective memory intervention improved adherence to antihypertensive medications and to assess whether executive function and working memory processes moderated the intervention effects.
AB  - DESIGN: Two-group longitudinal randomized control trial.
AB  - SETTING: Community.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 65 and older without signs of dementia or symptoms of severe depression who were self-managing prescribed medication.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: After 4 weeks of initial adherence monitoring using a medication event monitoring system, individuals with 90% or less adherence were randomly assigned to groups.
AB  - INTERVENTION: The prospective memory intervention was designed to provide strategies that switch older adults from relying on executive function and working memory processes (that show effects of cognitive aging) to mostly automatic associative processes (that are relatively spared with normal aging) for remembering to take medications. Strategies included establishing a routine, establishing cues strongly associated with medication taking actions, performing the action immediately upon thinking about it, using a medication organizer, and imagining medication taking to enhance encoding and improve cuing.
AB  - RESULTS: There was significant improvement in adherence in the intervention group (57% at baseline to 78% after the intervention), but most of these gains were lost after 5 months. The control condition started at 68% and was stable during the intervention, but dropped to 62%. Executive function and working memory moderated the intervention effect, with the intervention producing greater benefit for those with lower executive function and working memory.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The intervention improved adherence, but the benefits were not sustained. Further research is needed to determine how to sustain the substantial initial benefits.© 2016, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation © 2016, The American Geriatrics Society.

TI  - A Successful Multifaceted Trial to Improve Hypertension Control in Primary Care: Why Did it Work?.
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is important to understand which components of successful multifaceted interventions are responsible for study outcomes, since some components may be more important contributors to the intervention effect than others.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We conducted a mediation analysis to determine which of seven factors had the greatest effect on change in systolic blood pressure (BP) after 6 months in a trial to improve hypertension control.
AB  - DESIGN: The study was a preplanned secondary analysis of a cluster-randomized clinical trial. Eight clinics in an integrated health system were randomized to provide usual care to their patients (n=222), and eight were randomized to provide a telemonitoring intervention (n=228).
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred three of 450 trial participants completing the 6-month follow-up visit were included.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Intervention group participants received home BP telemonitors and transmitted measurements to pharmacists, who adjusted medications and provided advice to improve adherence to medications and lifestyle modification via telephone visits.
AB  - MAIN MEASURES: Path analytic models estimated indirect effects of the seven potential mediators of intervention effect (defined as the difference between the intervention and usual care groups in change in systolic BP from baseline to 6 months). The potential mediators were change in home BP monitor use, number of BP medication classes, adherence to BP medications, physical activity, salt intake, alcohol use, and weight.
AB  - KEY RESULTS: The difference in change in systolic BP was 11.3 mmHg. The multivariable mediation model explained 47 % (5.3 mmHg) of the intervention effect. Nearly all of this was mediated by two factors: an increase in medication treatment intensity (24 %) and increased home BP monitor use (19 %). The other five factors were not significant mediators, although medication adherence and salt intake improved more in the intervention group than in the usual care group.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Most of the explained intervention effect was attributable to the combination of self-monitoring and medication intensification. High adherence at baseline and the relatively low intensity of resources directed toward lifestyle change may explain why these factors did not contribute to the improvement in BP.

TI  - Pharmacist intervention in improving hypertension-related knowledge, treatment medication adherence and health-related quality of life: a non-clinical randomized controlled trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study evaluated whether a pharmaceutical care intervention can result in better understanding about hypertension, increase medication adherence to antihypertensive therapy and improve overall health-related quality of life.
AB  - METHODS: A non-clinical randomized control trial was conducted whereby participants received an educational intervention through hospital pharmacists. Hypertension knowledge, medication adherence and health-related quality of life were measured by means of self-administered questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the demographic and disease characteristics of the patients. Inferential statistics were used for inter- and intragroup comparisons. SPSS 17 was used for data analysis.
AB  - RESULTS: Three hundred and eighty-five hypertensive patients were randomly assigned (192 in the control group and 193 in the intervention group) to the study. No significant differences were observed in either group for age, gender, income, locality, education, occupation or duration of disease. There was, however, a significant increase in the participants' levels of knowledge about hypertension and medication adherence among the interventional group after completing the intervention. Significantly lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels were also observed among the interventional group after completion of the intervention. The interventional group, however, reported decreased yet significant health-related quality of life at the end of the interventional programme.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Pharmacist intervention can significantly increase disease-related knowledge, blood pressure control and medication adherence in patients with hypertension. However, further research is needed to address the decreased health-related quality of life after completion of the study.Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Medication Routines and Adherence Among Hypertensive African Americans.
AB  - Poor adherence to prescribed medication regimens remains an important challenge preventing successful treatment of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension. While studies have documented differences in the time of day or weekday vs weekend on medication adherence, no study has examined whether having a medication-taking routine contributes to increased medication adherence. The purpose of this study was to: (1) identify patients' sociodemographic factors associated with consistent medication-taking routine; (2) examine associations between medication-taking consistency, medication adherence, and blood pressure (BP) control. The study included black patients with hypertension (n = 190; 22 men and 168 women; age, mean+/-standard deviation 54 +/- 12.08 years) who completed a practice-based randomized controlled trial. Findings showed that medication-taking consistency was significantly associated with better medication adherence (F = 9.54, P = .002). Associations with the consistency index were not statistically significant for diastolic BP control (odds ratio, 1.319; 95% confidence interval, 0.410-4.246; P = .642) and systolic BP control (odds ratio, 0.621; 95% confidence interval, 0.195-1.974; P = .419).

TI  - Association between perceived life chaos and medication adherence in a postmyocardial infarction population.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The benefits of medication adherence to control cardiovascular disease (CVD) are well defined, yet multiple studies have identified poor adherence. The influence of life chaos on medication adherence is unknown. Because this is a novel application of an instrument, our preliminary objective was to understand patient factors associated with chaos. The main objective was to evaluate the extent to which an instrument designed to measure life chaos is associated with CVD-medication nonadherence.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: Using baseline data from an ongoing randomized trial to improve postmyocardial infarction (MI) management, multivariable logistic regression identified the association between life chaos and CVD-medication nonadherence. Patients had hypertension and a myocardial infarction in the past 3 years (n=406). Nearly 43% reported CVD-medication nonadherence in the past month. In simple linear regression, the following were associated with higher life chaos: medication nonadherence (beta=1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96-2.76), female sex (beta=1.22; 95% CI [0.22-2.24]), minority race (beta=1.72; 95% CI [0.78-2.66]), having less than high school education (beta=2.05; 95% CI [0.71-3.39]), low health literacy (beta=2.06; 95% CI [0.86-3.26]), and inadequate financial status (beta=1.93; 95% CI [0.87-3.00]). Being married (beta=-2.09, 95% CI [-3.03 to -1.15]) was associated with lower life chaos. As chaos quartile increased, patients exhibited more nonadherence. In logistic regression, adjusting for sex, race, marital status, employment, education, health literacy, and financial status, a 1-unit life chaos increase was associated with a 7% increase (odds ratio, 1.07; 95% CI [1.02-1.12]) in odds of reporting medication nonadherence.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that life chaos may be an important determinant of medication adherence. Life chaos screenings could identify those at risk for nonadherence.

TI  - Mobile Phone Text Messages to Support Treatment Adherence in Adults With High Blood Pressure (SMS-Text Adherence Support [StAR]): A Single-Blind, Randomized Trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We assessed the effect of automated treatment adherence support delivered via mobile phone short message system (SMS) text messages on blood pressure.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: In this pragmatic, single-blind, 3-arm, randomized trial (SMS-Text Adherence Support [StAR]) undertaken in South Africa, patients treated for high blood pressure were randomly allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to information only, interactive SMS text messaging, or usual care. The primary outcome was change in systolic blood pressure at 12 months from baseline measured with a validated oscillometric device. All trial staff were masked to treatment allocation. Analyses were intention to treat. Between June 26, 2012, and November 23, 2012, 1372 participants were randomized to receive information-only SMS text messages (n=457), interactive SMS text messages (n=458), or usual care (n=457). Primary outcome data were available for 1256 participants (92%). At 12 months, the mean adjusted change in systolic blood pressure compared with usual care was -2.2 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, -4.4 to -0.04) with information-only SMS and -1.6 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, -3.7 to 0.6) with interactive SMS. Odds ratios for the proportion of participants with a blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg were 1.42 (95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.95) for information-only messaging and 1.41 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.95) for interactive messaging compared with usual care.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized trial of an automated adherence support program delivered by SMS text message in a general outpatient population of adults with high blood pressure, we found a small reduction in systolic blood pressure control compared with usual care at 12 months. There was no evidence that an interactive intervention increased this effect.

TI  - Medication Adherence and the Risk of Cardiovascular Mortality and Hospitalization Among Patients With Newly Prescribed Antihypertensive Medications.
AB  - The importance of adherence to antihypertensive treatments for the prevention of cardiovascular disease has not been well elucidated. This study evaluated the effect of antihypertensive medication adherence on specific cardiovascular disease mortality (ischemic heart disease [IHD], cerebral hemorrhage, and cerebral infarction). Our study used data from a 3% sample cohort that was randomly extracted from enrollees of Korean National Health Insurance. Study subjects were aged >20 years, were diagnosed with hypertension, and started newly prescribed antihypertensive medication in 2003 to 2004. Adherence to antihypertensive medication was estimated as the cumulative medication adherence. Subjects were divided into good (cumulative medication adherence, >80%), intermediate (cumulative medication adherence, 50%-80%), and poor (cumulative medication adherence, <50%) adherence groups. We used time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the association between medication adherence and health outcomes. Among 33728 eligible subjects, 670 (1.99%) died of coronary heart disease or stroke during follow-up. Patients with poor medication adherence had worse mortality from IHD (hazard ratio, 1.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-2.31; P for trend=0.005), cerebral hemorrhage (hazard ratio, 2.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-3.77; P for trend=0.004), and cerebral infarction (hazard ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-2.96; P for trend=0.003) than those with good adherence. The estimated hazard ratios of hospitalization for cardiovascular disease were consistent with the mortality end point. Poor medication adherence was associated with higher mortality and a greater risk of hospitalization for specific cardiovascular diseases, emphasizing the importance of a monitoring system and strategies to improve medication adherence in clinical practice.

TI  - True antihypertensive efficacy of sequential nephron blockade in patients with resistant hypertension and confirmed medication adherence.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We assessed the influence of medication adherence on blood pressure (BP) control and target organ damage in a pre-specified analysis of a published trial comparing sequential nephron blockade (SNB) or sequential renin-angiotensin system blockade (SRASB) in patients with resistant hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: Patients were randomized to SNB (n = 82) or SRASB (n = 82) and studied at baseline and after 12 weeks. BP was measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured by applanation tonometry and left ventricular mass (LVM) by echocardiography. Low medication adherence was assessed through plasma irbesartan concentration below 20 ng/ml; urinary N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline/creatinine ratio below 4  nmol/mmol; last medication intake before visit greater than 24 h and pill counting below 80% of theoretical intake. Medication adherence score (sum of items, max = 4) is defined as low (medication adherence score <2) or acceptable (medication adherence score >2).
AB  - RESULTS: Among 164 patients, 134 (81.7%) had acceptable medication adherence and 30 (18.3%) low medication adherence, with similar proportions in the SNB and SRASB arms. After 12 weeks, in patients with acceptable medication adherence, BP was more frequently controlled in those treated with SNB (64%), than SRASB (18%; P < 0.001). The difference in daytime SBP was -11.5  mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI) -15.4 to -7.5, P < 0.0001] in patients with acceptable medication adherence. In contrast, in patients with low medication adherence, the difference between groups was smaller and not significant (-9.4  mmHg, 95% CI -20.4 to 1.7, P = 0.09). Independently of BP changes, PWV and LVM decreased more in the SNB than in the SRASB arm when medication adherence was acceptable (-0.52 m/s, 95% CI -1.3 to -0.007, P = 0.047; and -24 g/m, 95% CI -36 to -12, P = 0.0003), whereas no significant changes were observed in low medication adherence patients.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Medication adherence contributes to BP-lowering and regression of target organ damage. The differential effects of SNB and SRASB is observed in patients with acceptable medication adherence, and not in patients with low medication adherence.

TI  - Blood-Pressure and Cholesterol Lowering in Persons without Cardiovascular Disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elevated blood pressure and elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Lowering both should reduce the risk of cardiovascular events substantially.
AB  - METHODS: In a trial with 2-by-2 factorial design, we randomly assigned 12,705 participants at intermediate risk who did not have cardiovascular disease to rosuvastatin (10 mg per day) or placebo and to candesartan (16 mg per day) plus hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg per day) or placebo. In the analyses reported here, we compared the 3180 participants assigned to combined therapy (with rosuvastatin and the two antihypertensive agents) with the 3168 participants assigned to dual placebo. The first coprimary outcome was the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke, and the second coprimary outcome additionally included heart failure, cardiac arrest, or revascularization. The median follow-up was 5.6 years.
AB  - RESULTS: The decrease in the LDL cholesterol level was 33.7 mg per deciliter (0.87 mmol per liter) greater in the combined-therapy group than in the dual-placebo group, and the decrease in systolic blood pressure was 6.2 mm Hg greater with combined therapy than with dual placebo. The first coprimary outcome occurred in 113 participants (3.6%) in the combined-therapy group and in 157 (5.0%) in the dual-placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 0.90; P=0.005). The second coprimary outcome occurred in 136 participants (4.3%) and 187 participants (5.9%), respectively (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.89; P=0.003). Muscle weakness and dizziness were more common in the combined-therapy group than in the dual-placebo group, but the overall rate of discontinuation of the trial regimen was similar in the two groups.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The combination of rosuvastatin (10 mg per day), candesartan (16 mg per day), and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg per day) was associated with a significantly lower rate of cardiovascular events than dual placebo among persons at intermediate risk who did not have cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Medication non-adherence after myocardial infarction: an exploration of modifying factors.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication non-adherence is a major impediment to the management of cardiovascular disease risk factors. A better understanding of the modifying factors underlying medication non-adherence among individuals with known cardiovascular disease may inform approaches for addressing non-adherence.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify demographic and patient characteristics, medical comorbidities, psychosocial factors, and health belief-related factors associated with medication non-adherence among patients with known cardiovascular disease.
AB  - DESIGN: We performed secondary analysis of baseline data from a randomized trial.
AB  - PATIENTS: The study included 405 patients with a diagnosis of hypertension and history of acute myocardial infarction that was diagnosed within a three-year period prior to enrollment.
AB  - MAIN MEASURES: Baseline demographics and patient characteristics, medical comorbidities, psychosocial factors, health belief-related factors, and patient-reported medication non-adherence were analyzed.
AB  - KEY RESULTS: Of 405 patients, 173 (42.7 %) reported medication non-adherence. Factors associated with non-adherence in bivariate analysis included younger age, non-white race, having less than 12 years of education, smoking, financial insecurity, identifying as nervous or tense, higher life chaos score, greater worry about having a myocardial infarction, and greater worry about having a stroke. Using multivariable modeling, we determined that age (OR 0.97 per additional year, 95 % CI, 0.95-0.99), life chaos (OR 1.06 per additional point, 95 % CI, 1.00-1.11), and worry about stroke (OR 1.12 per additional point, 95 % CI, 1.01-1.25) remained significantly associated with self-reported medication non-adherence.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: We found that worry about having a stroke, higher life chaos, and younger age were all significantly associated with self-reported medication non-adherence in patients with cardiovascular disease and a history of myocardial infarction. Further research exploring these factors as targets for intervention is needed, as is additional research examining modifiable causes of medication non-adherence among patients with cardiovascular disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Western countries, better knowledge about patient-related determinants of treatment adherence (medication and lifestyle) is needed to improve treatment adherence and outcomes among hypertensive ethnic minority patients of African descent.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify patient-related determinants of adherence to lifestyle and medication recommendations among hypertensive African Surinamese and Ghanaian patients with suboptimal treatment results (SBP>140) living in the Netherlands and how culturally appropriate hypertension education (CAHE) influenced those determinants.
AB  - METHODS: This study analysed data of 139 patients who participated in the CAHE trial. Univariate logistic regression analysis was used to measure the association between patient-related determinants (medication self-efficacy, beliefs about medication and hypertension, social support, and satisfaction with care) and treatment adherence. We also tested whether CAHE influenced the determinants.
AB  - RESULTS: Medication self-efficacy and social support were associated with medication adherence at baseline. At six months, more medication self-efficacy and fewer concerns about medication use were associated with improved medication adherence. Self-efficacy was also associated with adherence to lifestyle recommendations at baseline. CAHE influenced patients' illness perceptions by creating more understanding of hypertension, its chronic character, and more concerns about the associated risks.
AB  - CONCLUSION: In this high-risk population, health care providers can support medication adherence by paying attention to patients' medication self-efficacy, the concerns they may have about medication use and patients' perceptions on hypertension. The CAHE intervention improved patients' perception on hypertension.

TI  - A centralized cardiovascular risk service to improve guideline adherence in private primary care offices.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many large health systems now employ clinical pharmacists in team-based care to assist patients and physicians with management of cardiovascular (CV) diseases. However, small private offices often lack the resources to hire a clinical pharmacist for their office. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a centralized, web-based CV risk service (CVRS) managed by clinical pharmacists will improve guideline adherence in primary care medical offices in rural and small communities.
AB  - METHODS: This study is a cluster randomized prospective trial in 12 primary care offices. Medical offices were randomized to either the CVRS intervention or usual care. The intervention will last for 12 months and all subjects will have research visits at baseline and 12 months. Primary outcomes will include adherence to treatment guidelines and control of key CV risk factors. Data will also be abstracted from the medical record at 30 months to determine if the intervention effect is sustained after it is discontinued.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This study will enroll subjects through 2015 and results will be available in 2018. This study will provide information on whether a distant, centralized CV risk service can improve guideline adherence in medical offices that lack the resources to employ clinical pharmacists.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Monotherapy versus dual therapy for the initial treatment of hypertension (PATHWAY-1): a randomised double-blind controlled trial.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have suggested that more intensive initial therapy for hypertension results in better long-term blood pressure (BP) control. We test this hypothesis comparing initial monotherapy with dual therapy in the management of essential hypertension.
AB  - METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is a prospective, multicentre, double-blind, active-controlled trial in patients with essential hypertension. Around 50% of patients studied will be newly diagnosed and the others will be known hypertensives who previously received only monotherapy. The trial is divided into three phases as follows: Phase 1 (Week 0-Week 16): Randomised, parallel-group, masked assignation to either combination or monotherapy. Phase 2 (Week 17-Week 32): Open-label combination therapy. Phase 3 (Week 33-Week 52): Open-label combination therapy plus open-label add-on (if BP is above 140/90 mm Hg). Hierarchical primary end points are: a comparison of home BP (home systolic blood pressure (HSBP)) averaged over the duration of phase 1 and 2 in the combination versus monotherapy arms. If combination is superior in this analysis, then the averaged mean HSBP between initial monotherapy and initial combination therapy at the end of phase 2 will be compared. Secondary end points include: BP control at 1 year; the role of age, baseline renin, sodium status, plasma volume, haemodynamic compensation and peripheral resistance on BP control; validation of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence/British Hypertension Society joint guideline algorithm; safety and tolerability of combination therapy; and the impact of combination versus monotherapy on left ventricular mass and aortic pulse wave velocity. A sample size of 536 (268 in each group) will have 90% power to detect a difference in means of 4 mm Hg.
AB  - ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: PATHWAY 1 was approved by UK ethics (REC Reference 09/H0308/132). Trial results will be published and all participating subjects will be informed of the results.

TI  - Pilot Study to Test the Effectiveness of Different Financial Incentives to Improve Medication Adherence.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication nonadherence affects health care costs, morbidity, and mortality. Concepts from behavioral economics can guide the development of interventions to improve medication adherence.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure the relative effectiveness of 2 behavioral economic-based incentive structures to improve medication adherence.
AB  - METHODS: This randomized controlled trial compared adherence among participants taking antihypertensive or antihyperlipidemic medications randomized to usual care (UC), guaranteed pay-out (GPO) incentives, or lottery incentives. Daily adherence was measured over a 90-day period using electronic caps (Medication Event Monitoring System [MEMS]). The GPO group received $30 up-front in a virtual account, with $0.50 deducted for each missed dose. Lottery group participants were eligible for a weekly $50 drawing, but only if they had taken their medication as prescribed all week. An electronic survey assessed self-reported adherence. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, paired t tests, ANOVA, and Pearson's correlations.
AB  - RESULTS: In all, 36 participants were randomized (UC, n = 11; GPO, n = 14; lottery, n = 11). Mean percentage (+/-SD) of days adherent during the incentive period was highest in the lottery group (96% +/- 5%), followed by the GPO group (94% +/- 9%) and the UC group (94% +/- 9%). There were no statistically significant differences among groups (P > 0.05). MEMS-measured adherence was not significantly correlated with a patient's self-reported adherence (P > 0.05) at baseline but was correlated at 90-day follow-up (P < 0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Although no statistically significant differences in adherence were demonstrated in this small sample of highly adherent participants, larger studies in a more diverse population or with other medications might show otherwise.Copyright © The Author(s) 2015.

TI  - Performance and persistence of a blood pressure self-management intervention: telemonitoring and self-management in hypertension (TASMINH2) trial.
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate, in detail, the implementation of the self-management intervention used in the TASMINH2 trial. The intervention, comprising self-monitoring for the first week of each month and an individualised treatment self-titration schedule, was developed from a previous trial of self-management. Two hundred and sixty-three patients with poorly controlled but treated hypertension were randomised to receive this intervention and underwent training over two or three sessions. Participants were followed up for 12 months during which time process data were collected regarding the persistence and fidelity of actual behaviour compared with intervention recommendations. Two hundred and forty-one (92%) patients completed training of whom 188 (72%) self-managed their BP and completed at least 90% of expected self-monitoring measurements for the full year of the study. Overall, 268/483 (55%) of recommended medication changes were implemented. Only 25 (13%) patients had controlled BP throughout the year and so were not recommended any medication changes. Adherence to the protocol reduced over time as the number of potential changes increased. Of those self-managing throughout, 131 (70%) made at least one medication change, with 77 (41%) implementing all their recommended changes. In conclusion, self-management of hypertension was possible in practice with most participants making at least one medication change. Although adherence to the intervention reduced over time, implementation of treatment recommendations appeared better than equivalent trials using physician titration. Future self-management interventions should aim to better support patients' decision making, perhaps through enhanced use of technology.

TI  - Pharmacist intervention for blood pressure control: medication intensification and adherence.
AB  - The objective of this study was to describe medication adherence and medication intensification in a physician-pharmacist collaborative management (PPCM) model compared with usual care. This study was a prospective, cluster, randomized study in 32 primary care offices from 15 states. The primary outcomes were medication adherence and anti-hypertensive medication changes during the first 9 months of the intervention. The 9-month visit was completed by 539 patients, 345 of which received the intervention. There was no significant difference between intervention and usual care patients in regards to medication adherence at 9 months. Intervention patients received significantly more medication changes (4.9 vs.1.1; P = .0003) and had significantly increased use of diuretics and aldosterone antagonists when compared with usual care (P = .01).The PPCM model increased medication intensification; however, no significant change in medication adherence was detected. PPCM models will need to develop non-adherence identification and intervention methods to further improve the potency of the care team. Copyright © 2015 American Society of Hypertension.

TI  - A practice-based randomized controlled trial to improve medication adherence among Latinos with hypertension: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Latinos experience disproportionately higher rates of uncontrolled hypertension as compared to Blacks and Whites. While poor adherence is a major contributor to disparities in blood pressure control, data in Latino patients are scant. More importantly, translation of interventions to improve medication adherence in community-based primary care practices, where the majority of Latino patients receive their care is non-existent.
AB  - METHODS: Using a randomized controlled design, this study evaluates the effectiveness of a culturally tailored, practice-based intervention compared to usual care on medication adherence, among 148 Latino patients with uncontrolled hypertension who are non-adherent to their antihypertensive medications. Bilingual medical assistants trained as Health Coaches deliver the intervention using an electronic medical record system-embedded adherence script. Patients randomized to the intervention group receive patient-centered counseling with a Health Coach to develop individualized self-monitoring strategies to overcome barriers and improve adherence behaviors. Health Coach sessions are held biweekly for the first 3 months (6 sessions total) and then monthly for the remaining 3 months (3 sessions total). Patients randomized to the usual care group receive standard hypertension treatment recommendations as determined by their primary care providers. The primary outcome is the rate of medication adherence at 6 months. The secondary outcome is reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 6 months.
AB  - DISCUSSION: If successful, findings from this study will provide salient information on the translation of culturally tailored, evidence-based interventions targeted at medication adherence and blood pressure control into practice-based settings for this high-risk population.

TI  - Improving Medication Adherence in Patients with Hypertension: A Randomized Trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In patients with hypertension, medication adherence is often suboptimal, thereby increasing the risk of ischemic heart disease and stroke. In a randomized trial, we investigated the effectiveness of a multifaceted pharmacist intervention in a hospital setting to improve medication adherence in hypertensive patients. Motivational interviewing was a key element of the intervention.
AB  - METHODS: Patients (n = 532) were recruited from 3 hospital outpatient clinics and randomized to usual care or a 6-month pharmacist intervention comprising collaborative care, medication review, and tailored adherence counseling including motivational interviewing and telephone follow-ups. The primary outcome was composite medication possession ratio (MPR) to antihypertensive and lipid-lowering agents, at 1-year follow-up, assessed by analyzing pharmacy records. Secondary outcomes at 12 months included persistence to medications, blood pressure, hospital admission, and a combined clinical endpoint of cardiovascular death, stroke, or acute myocardial infarction.
AB  - RESULTS: At 12 months, 20.3% of the patients in the intervention group (n = 231) were nonadherent (MPR <0.80), compared with 30.2% in the control group (n = 285) (risk difference -9.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], -17.3, -2.4) and median MPR (interquartile range) was 0.93 (0.82-0.99) and 0.91 (0.76-0.98), respectively, P = .02. The combined clinical endpoint was reached by 1.3% in the intervention group and 3.1% in the control group (relative risk 0.41; 95% CI, 0.11-1.50). No significant differences were found for persistence, blood pressure, or hospital admission.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A multifaceted pharmacist intervention in a hospital setting led to a sustained improvement in medication adherence for patients with hypertension. The intervention had no significant impact on blood pressure and secondary clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - [PRAdA intervention: effects on weight of dietary intervention among treated hypertensive Portuguese natives and African immigrants]. [Portuguese]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Blood pressure is significantly improved with weight loss. Behavioral interventions for weight loss seem to be less successful in African immigrants. Our main aims were to assess the effect of a dietary and lifestyle intervention on weight among hypertensive Portuguese natives and immigrants and to identify success factors for weight loss, and also to evaluate changes in knowledge and compliance with food recommendations.
AB  - MATERIAL AND METHODS: Hypertensive medicated patients followed in primary care setting were randomly enrolled in a two phase study, observational (15-months) and behavioral intervention (six months). Participants were divided in two groups: immigrants from African Countries of Portuguese Official Language and Portuguese natives. Participants were given dietary and life styles recommendations in individual face-to-face and telephone sessions.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 110 participants with a mean BMI of 31.6 +/- 3.7 Kg/m(2), 60 were immigrants. The number of dietary recommendations known and followed at the end was significantly greater than at baseline; however natives performed a greater number of recommendations. Weight loss during intervention was in average 1.4 +/- 2.7% in natives and 0.8 +/- 3.6% in immigrants and was greater than in the observational period. Being male and consuming more than 2 servings of low-fat dairy products/day was associated with higher weight loss, independently of age and ethnicity.
AB  - DISCUSSION: In general the proposed intervention was efficacious especially in Portuguese natives, confirming other studies.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The intervention increased knowledge and adherence to recommendations, highlighting the relevance of nutrition education, culturally adapted in primary care.

TI  - Training in ChiRunning to reduce blood pressure: a randomized controlled pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: People with prehypertension (120-130/80-90 mmHg) are at increased risk of progressing to hypertension. Recommendations for prehypertension include engaging in regular physical activity. We aimed to assess feasibility and acceptability and collect preliminary outcome data on ChiRunning for people with elevated blood pressure. ChiRunning is a commercially available running program based on the mindful movements of Tai Chi, which is aimed at decreasing injury by both increasing body awareness and modifying running form.
AB  - METHODS: We enrolled adults with elevated systolic (130-150 mmHg) or diastolic (80-100 mmHg) blood pressure in a 12-week pilot trial. Participants were randomized 2:1:1 to 8 weeks of: 1) intervention-a trainer-led ChiRunning group (n=10); 2) active control-a trainer-led running group (n=6); or 3) educational control-a self-directed running group (n=6) and followed for 4 more weeks. The active control and educational control groups were combined for analysis.
AB  - RESULTS: This study was feasible, meeting recruitment, retention and adherence goals, and acceptable to participants. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly over the study for either the ChiRunning or control groups. Changes in BMI over time were significantly different from zero in the ChiRunning group (p=0.04) but not in the control group (slope for ChiRunning -0.05 [-0.1 to -0.002] vs. control -0.01 [-0.06 to 0.04], between slope difference, p=0.22). Self-reported running-related injury (i.e. discomfort leading to a decrease in running) was similar between groups (ChiRunning, 4 [1.2 to 8.4] vs. control, 3 [0.7 to 7.1] injuries per 100 h of running, p=0.72) although self-reported running-related discomfort (i.e. discomfort that does not lead to changes in running) trended higher in the ChiRunning group (ChiRunning, 10 [5.4 to 16.8] vs. control, 4 [1.5 to 9] reports of discomfort per 100 h of running, p=0.06).
AB  - CONCLUSION: ChiRunning appears to be a feasible and acceptable exercise program for people with elevated blood pressure. We did not find that ChiRunning had a significant impact on blood pressure or self reported injury, but did see a positive change in BMI over time. ChiRunning warrants further investigation in a larger trial.

TI  - Improving adherence in African American women with uncontrolled hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: African American women are disproportionately affected with hypertension (HTN). The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of a 6-week culturally tailored educational intervention for 60 African American women with HTN.
AB  - METHODS: Sixty African American women, 29 to 86 years old (mean +/- SD, 57.98 +/- 12.37 years), with primary HTN were recruited from 4 rural locations and randomized to intervention (n = 30) and control (n = 30) groups to determine the effectiveness of the intervention on knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, social support, adherence to an HTN regimen, and blood pressure control. Culturally tailored educational classes were provided for 90 minutes once a week for 6 weeks. The control group received usual care.
AB  - RESULTS: A significant favorable overall main effect (time) was found for systolic blood pressure (F3,174 = 11.104, P = .000) and diastolic blood pressure (F3,174 = 4.781, P = .003) for both groups. Also for diastolic blood pressure, older age was a significant covariate (F1,56 = 6.798, P = .012). Older participants tended to have increased diastolic blood pressures. There were no significant differences between groups on knowledge, adherence, or attitudes.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The culturally tailored program used the African American church as a basis for recruitment and implementation of the program that retained all participants over a 6-month period. African American women living in rural Texas who participated in a 6-week intervention program demonstrated a significant decrease in blood pressure over a 6-month period regardless of whether they were in the intervention or control group. In general, they had a relatively good knowledge of HTN and reported an average level of adherence. Future studies using a culturally tailored program with a larger sample size are warranted to decrease the high level of HTN-related complications in African American women.

TI  - Improving treatment adherence for blood pressure lowering via mobile phone SMS-messages in South Africa: a qualitative evaluation of the SMS-text Adherence SuppoRt (StAR) trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Effective use of proven treatments for high blood pressure, a preventable health risk, is challenging for many patients. Prompts via mobile phone SMS-text messaging may improve adherence to clinic visits and treatment, though more research is needed on impact and patient perceptions of such support interventions, especially in low-resource settings.
AB  - METHOD: An individually-randomised controlled trial in a primary care clinic in Cape Town (2012-14), tested the effect of an adherence support intervention delivered via SMS-texts, on blood pressure control and adherence to medication, for hypertensive patients. (
AB  - TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02019823). We report on a qualitative evaluation that explored the trial participants' experiences and responses to the SMS-text messages, and identified barriers and facilitators to delivering adherence support via patients' own mobile phones. Two focus groups and fifteen individual interviews were conducted. We used comparative and thematic analysis approaches to identify themes and triangulated our analysis amongst three researchers.
AB  - RESULTS: Most participants were comfortable with the technology of using SMS-text messages. Messages were experienced as acceptable, relevant and useful to a broad range of participants. The SMS-content, the respectful tone and the delivery (timing of reminders and frequency) and the relational aspect of trial participation (feeling cared for) were all highly valued. A subgroup who benefitted the most, were those who had been struggling with adherence due to high levels of personal stress. The intervention appeared to coincide with their readiness for change, and provided practical and emotional support for improving adherence behaviour. Change may have been facilitated through increased acknowledgement of their health status and attitudinal change towards greater self-responsibility. Complex interaction of psycho-social stressors and health service problems were reported as broader challenges to adherence behaviours.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Adherence support for treatment of raised blood pressure, delivered via SMS-text message on the patient's own phone, was found to be acceptable, relevant and helpful, even for those who already had their own reminder systems in place. Our findings begin to identify for whom and what core elements of the SMS-text message intervention appear to work best in a low-resource operational setting, issues that future research should explore in greater depth.

TI  - A pragmatic randomized trial of a polypill-based strategy to improve use of indicated preventive treatments in people at high cardiovascular disease risk.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most individuals at high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk worldwide do not receive any or optimal preventive drugs. We aimed to determine whether fixed dose combinations of generic drugs ('polypills') would promote use of such medications.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted a randomized, open-label trial involving 623 participants from Australian general practices. Participants had established CVD or an estimated five-year CVD risk of >15%, with indications for antiplatelet, statin and >2 blood pressure lowering drugs ('combination treatment'). Participants randomized to the 'polypill-based strategy' received a polypill containing aspirin 75mg, simvastatin 40mg, lisinopril 10mg and either atenolol 50mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg. Participants randomized to 'usual care' continued with separate medications and doses as prescribed by their doctor. Primary outcomes were self-reported combination treatment use, systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol.
AB  - RESULTS: After a median of 18 months, the polypill-based strategy was associated with greater use of combination treatment (70% vs. 47%; relative risk 1.49, (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30 to 1.72) p<0.0001; number needed to treat=4.4 (3.3 to 6.6)) without differences in systolic blood pressure (-1.5mmHg (95% CI -4.0 to 1.0) p=0.24) or total cholesterol (0.08mmol/l (95% CI -0.06 to 0.22) p=0.26). At study end, 17% and 67% of participants in polypill and usual care groups, respectively, were taking atorvastatin or rosuvastatin.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Provision of a polypill improved self-reported use of indicated preventive treatments. The lack of differences in blood pressure and cholesterol may reflect limited study power, although for cholesterol, improved statin use in the polypill group counter-balanced use of more potent statins with usual care.Copyright © The European Society of Cardiology 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.

TI  - The FAITH Trial: Baseline Characteristics of a Church-based Trial to Improve Blood Pressure Control in Blacks.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the baseline characteristics of participants in the Faith-based Approaches in the Treatment of Hypertension (FAITH) Trial.
AB  - DESIGN: FAITH evaluates the effectiveness of a faith-based lifestyle intervention vs health education control on blood pressure (BP) reduction among hypertensive Black adults.
AB  - SETTING PARTICIPANTS AND MAIN MEASURES: Participants included 373 members of 32 Black churches in New York City. Baseline data collected included participant demographic characteristics, clinical measures (eg, blood pressure), behaviors (eg, diet, physical activity), and psychosocial factors (eg, self-efficacy, depressive symptoms).
AB  - RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 63.4 +/- 11.9 years and 76% were female. About half completed at least some college (53%), 66% had an income >$20,000, and 42.2% were retired or on disability. Participants had a mean systolic and diastolic BP of 152.1 +/- 16.8 mm Hg and 86.2 +/- 12.2 mm Hg, respectively, and a mean BMI of 32 kg/m2. Hypertension (HTN) medications were taken by 95% of participants, but most (79.1%) reported non-adherence to their regimen. Participants reported consuming 3.4 +/- 2.6 servings of fruits and vegetables and received 30.9% of their energy from fat. About one-third (35.9%) reported a low activity level.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Participants in the FAITH trial exhibited several adverse clinical and behavioral characteristics at baseline. Future analyses will evaluate the effectiveness of the faith-based lifestyle intervention on changes in BP and lifestyle behaviors among hypertensive Black adults.

TI  - Patient-reported medication adherence barriers among patients with cardiovascular risk factors.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients experience barriers that make it difficult to take cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related medications as prescribed. The Cardiovascular Intervention Improvement Telemedicine Study (CITIES) was a tailored behavioral pharmacist-administered and telephone-based intervention for reducing CVD risk.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To (a) describe patient-reported barriers to taking their medication as prescribed and (b) evaluate patient-level characteristics associated with reporting medication barriers.
AB  - METHODS: We recruited patients receiving care at primary care clinics affiliated with Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Eligible patients were diagnosed with hypertension and/or hyperlipidemia that were poorly controlled (blood pressure of > 150/100 mmHg and/or low-density lipoprotein value > 130 mg/dL). At the time of enrollment, patients completed an interview with 7 questions derived from a validated medication barriers measure. Patient characteristics and individual medication treatment barriers are described. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine the association between a medication barrier score and patient characteristics.
AB  - RESULTS: Most patients (n = 428) were married or living with their partners (57%) and were men (85%) who were diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia (64%). The most commonly reported barriers were having too much medication to take (31%) and forgetting whether medication was taken at a particular time (24%). In adjusted analysis, those who were not employed (1.32, 95% CI = 0.50-2.14) or did not have someone to help with tasks, if needed (1.66, 95% CI = 0.42-2.89), reported higher medication barrier scores. Compared with those diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia, those with only hypertension (0.91, 95% CI = 0.04-1.79) reported higher medication barrier scores.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Barriers to medication adherence are common. Evaluating and addressing barriers may increase medication adherence.

TI  - Effectiveness of pharmaceutical care at discharge in the emergency department: study protocol of a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient education on pharmacological therapy may increase medication adherence and decrease hospitalizations. Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of pharmaceutical care at emergency department discharge in patients with hypertension and/or diabetes.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: This is a randomized controlled trial. Participants will be recruited from a public emergency department at Restinga district in Porto Alegre, southern Brazil. A total of 380 patients will be randomly assigned into 2 groups at the moment of emergency department discharge after receiving medical orientations: an intervention group, consisting of a structured individual counseling session by a pharmacist in addition to written orientations, or a control group, consisting only of written information about the disease. Outcomes will be assessed in an ambulatory visit 2 months after the randomization. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with high medication adherence assessed using the Morisky-Green Test and the Brief Medication Questionnaire. The secondary outcomes are reduction of blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose, quality of life and number of visits to the emergency department.
AB  - DISCUSSION: Pharmaceutical care interventions have shown to be feasible and effective in increasing medication adherence in both hospital outpatient and community pharmacy settings. However, there have been no previous assessments of the effectiveness of pharmacy care interventions initiated in patients discharged from emergency departments. Our hypothesis is that pharmaceutical counseling is also effective in this population.

TI  - Clinical impacts of additive use of olmesartan in hypertensive patients with chronic heart failure: the supplemental benefit of an angiotensin receptor blocker in hypertensive patients with stable heart failure using olmesartan (SUPPORT) trial.
AB  - We examined whether an additive treatment with an angiotensin receptor blocker, olmesartan, reduces the mortality and morbidity in hypertensive patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, or both. In this prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint study, a total of 1147 hypertensive patients with symptomatic CHF (mean age 66 years, 75% male) were randomized to the addition of olmesartan (n = 578) to baseline therapy vs. control (n = 569). The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death, non-fatal acute myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and hospitalization for worsening heart failure. During a median follow-up of 4.4 years, the primary endpoint occurred in 192 patients (33.2%) in the olmesartan group and in 166 patients (29.2%) in the control group [hazard ratio (HR) 1.18; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.96-1.46, P = 0.112], while renal dysfunction developed more frequently in the olmesartan group (16.8 vs. 10.7%, HR 1.64; 95% CI 1.19-2.26, P = 0.003). Subgroup analysis revealed that addition of olmesartan to combination of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers was associated with increased incidence of the primary endpoint (38.1 vs. 28.2%, HR 1.47; 95% CI 1.11-1.95, P = 0.006), all-cause death (19.4 vs. 13.5%, HR 1.50; 95% CI 1.01-2.23, P = 0.046), and renal dysfunction (21.1 vs. 12.5%, HR 1.85; 95% CI 1.24-2.76, P = 0.003). Additive use of olmesartan did not improve clinical outcomes but worsened renal function in hypertensive CHF patients treated with evidence-based medications. Particularly, the triple combination therapy with olmesartan, ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers was associated with increased adverse cardiac events.

TI  - A pharmacist based intervention to improve the care of patients with CKD: a pragmatic, randomized, controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary care providers do not routinely follow guidelines for the care of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Multidisciplinary efforts may improve care for patients with chronic disease. Pharmacist based interventions have effectively improved management of hypertension. We performed a pragmatic, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the effect of a pharmacist based quality improvement program on 1) outcomes for patients with CKD and 2) adherence to CKD guidelines in the primary care setting.
AB  - METHODS: Patients with moderate to severe CKD receiving primary care services at one of thirteen community-based Veterans Affairs outpatient clinics were randomized to a multifactorial intervention that included a phone-based pharmacist intervention, pharmacist-physician collaboration, patient education, and a CKD registry (n=1070) or usual care (n=1129). The primary process outcome was measurement of parathyroid hormone (PTH) during the one year study period. The primary clinical outcome was blood pressure (BP) control in subjects with poorly controlled hypertension at baseline.
AB  - RESULTS: Among those with poorly controlled baseline BP, there was no difference in the last recorded BP or the percent at goal BP during the study period (42.0% vs. 41.2% in the control arm). Subjects in the intervention arm were more likely to have a PTH measured during the study period (46.9% vs. 16.1% in the control arm, P <0.001) and were on more classes of antihypertensive medications at the end of the study (P=0.02).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A one-time pharmacist based intervention proved feasible in patients with CKD. While the intervention did not improve BP control, it did improve guideline adherence and increased the number of antihypertensive medications prescribed to subjects with poorly controlled BP. These findings can inform the design of quality improvement programs and future studies which are needed to improve care of patients with CKD.

Sudarshan Kriya yoga (SKY) intervention is acknowledged for its positive impact on health. It is hypothesised that SKY would improve PLHIV's QOL, justifying an evaluation.
AB  - METHODS: In this open label randomized controlled pilot trial, 61 adult PLHIV with CD4 count more than 400 cells/micro l and Karnofsky scale score above 70 were enrolled. Those with cardiac disease, jaundice, tuberculosis, or on antiretroviral therapy/yoga intervention were excluded. All were given standard care, randomized to SKY intervention (31: I-SKY) and only standard of care in control (30: O-SOC) arms. The I-SKY participants were trained for six days to prepare for daily practice of SKY at home for 30 min. A validated 31-item WHOQOL-HIVBREF questionnaire was used to document effect in both arms from baseline to three visits at 4 wk interval.
AB  - RESULTS: Baseline QOL scores, hypertension and CD4 count were similar in both arms. An overall 6 per cent improvement of QOL scores was observed in I-SKY group as compared to O-SOC group, after controlling for baseline variables like age, gender, education and occupation ( p =0.016); 12 per cent for physical ( p =0.004), 11 per cent psychological (p =0.023) and 9 per cent level of independence (p =0.001) domains. Improvement in I-SKY observed at post-training and in the SKY adherence group showed increase in these two domains.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A significant improvement in QOL scores was observed for the three health related QOL domains in SKY intervention arm. This low cost strategy improved physical and psychological state of PLHIV calling for upscaling with effective monitoring for sustainability of quality of life.

TI  - [The Antihypertensive Effect of the Fixed Combination of Lisinopril and Amlodipine in Patients With Coronary Heart Disease After Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting]. [Russian]
AB  - Literature data and results of our own register have indicate that hypertension is one of the most common risk factor in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) who have undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). But despite proven benefits of control of hypertension after CABG adherence of patients to corresponding recommendations remains low. Fixed combinations of antihypertensive drugs are associated with better compliance. In 30 IHD patients after CABG we studied effects of fixed lisinoprillamlodipine combination. This combination was safe and had high antihypertensive activity. Practically all patients responded to therapy and achieved target level of arterial pressure.

TI  - Multidomain Lifestyle Interventions for the Prevention of Cognitive Decline After Ischemic Stroke: Randomized Trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cognitive impairment occurs in <30% of all stroke survivors. However, effective therapies aimed at preventing poststroke cognitive decline are lacking. We assessed the efficacy of a multidomain intervention on preventing cognitive decline after stroke.
AB  - METHODS: In this randomized, observer-blind trial patients were recruited within 3 months after an acute stroke in 5 Austrian neurological centers. Patients were assigned to a 24-month lifestyle-based multidomain intervention or standard stroke care. Primary outcomes were the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog) and occurrence of cognitive decline in the composite scores of at least 2 of 5 cognitive domains at 24 months.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 101 patients were randomized into multi-intervention and 101 into standard care during June 2010 and November 2012. Of them, 76 patients in the intervention group and 83 in the control group were included in the final intention-to-treat analysis. At 24 months, 8 of 76 (10.5%) patients in the intervention group and 10 of 83 (12.0%) patients in the control group showed cognitive decline corresponding to a relative risk reduction of 0.874 (95% confidence interval, 0.364-2.098). The change in ADAS-cog from baseline to 24 months was not different either (median 0 [IQR, -1 to 2] in both groups; P=0.808).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This trial found no benefit of 24-month multidomain intervention with focus on improvement in lifestyle and vascular risk factors on the incidence of poststroke cognitive decline in comparison with standard stroke care. Studies with a larger sample size are needed.

TI  - DASH diet, insulin resistance, and serum hs-CRP in polycystic ovary syndrome: a randomized controlled clinical trial.
AB  - UNLABELLED: This study was designed to assess the effects of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan on insulin resistance and serum hs-CRP in overweight and obese women with PCOS. This randomized controlled clinical trial was done on 48 women diagnosed with PCOS. Subjects were randomly assigned to consume either the control (n=24) or the DASH eating pattern (n=24) for 8 weeks. The DASH diet consisted of 52% carbohydrates, 18% proteins, and 30% total fats. It was designed to be rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products and low in saturated fats, cholesterol, refined grains, and sweets. Sodium content of the DASH diet was designed to be less than 2400mg/day. The control diet was also designed to contain 52% carbohydrates, 18% protein, and 30% total fat. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after 8 weeks intervention to measure -insulin resistance and serum hs-CRP levels. -Adherence to the DASH eating pattern, compared to the -control diet, resulted in a significant reduction of serum insulin levels (-1.88 vs. 2.89muIU/ml, p=0.03), HOMA-IR score (-0.45 vs. 0.80; p=0.01), and serum hs-CRP levels (-763.29 vs. 665.95ng/ml, p=0.009). Additionally, a significant reduction in waist (-5.2 vs. -2.1cm; p=0.003) and hip circumference (-5.9 vs. -1cm; p<0.0001) was also seen in the DASH group compared with the control group. In conclusion, consumption of the DASH eating pattern for 8 weeks in overweight and obese women with PCOS resulted in the improvement of insulin resistance, serum hs-CRP levels, and abdominal fat accumulation.

TI  - Adherence with antihypertensive drug therapy and the risk of heart failure in clinical practice.
AB  - Randomized clinical trials have shown that antihypertensive treatment reduces the risk of heart failure (HF). Limited evidence exists, however, on whether and to what extent this benefit is translated into real-life practice. A nested case-control study was carried out by including the cohort of 76 017 patients from Lombardy (Italy), aged 40 to 80 years, who were newly treated with antihypertensive drugs during 2005. Cases were the 622 patients who experienced hospitalization for HF from initial prescription until 2012. Up to 5 controls were randomly selected for each case. Logistic regression was used to model the HF risk associated with adherence to antihypertensive drugs, which was measured by the proportion of days covered by treatment (PDC). Data were adjusted for several covariates. Sensitivity analyses were performed to account for possible sources of systematic uncertainty. Compared with patients with very low adherence (PDC, <25%), low, intermediate, and high adherences were associated with progressively lower risk of HF, reduction in the high-adherence group (>75%) being 34% (95% confidence interval, 17%-48%). Similar effects were observed in younger (40-70 years) and older (71-80 years) patients and between patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics. There was no evidence that adherence with calcium-channel blockers reduced the HF risk. Antihypertensive treatment lowers the HF risk in real-life practice, but adherence to treatment is necessary for a substantial benefit to take place. This is the case with a variety of antihypertensive drugs. Copyright © 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.

TI  - Effects of a behavioral intervention that emphasizes spices and herbs on adherence to recommended sodium intake: results of the SPICE randomized clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: For decades, dietary sodium intake in the United States has remained high, and few studies have examined strategies for maintaining recommended intakes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined the effects of a behavioral intervention, which emphasized spices and herbs, on the maintenance of sodium intake at the recommended intake of 1500 mg/d in individuals to whom the US Dietary Guidelines for Americans apply.
AB  - DESIGN: We conducted a 2-phase study that included adults >18 y of age for whom Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends 1500 mg Na/d. The study was conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, from 2012 to 2014. In phase 1, 55 individuals consumed a low-sodium diet for 4 wk. Participants were provided all foods, snacks, and calorie-containing drinks. In phase 2, 40 participants from phase 1 were randomly assigned to either a behavioral intervention to reduce sodium intake (n = 20) or a self-directed control group (n = 20) for 20 wk. The primary study outcome was the change in mean 24-h urinary sodium excretion during phase 2. Linear regression analyses were used to determine intervention effects on urinary sodium excretion.
AB  - RESULTS: Participant characteristics were as follows: women: 65%; African American: 88%; hypertension: 63%; diabetes: 18%; mean age: 61 y; and mean body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 30. At the end of phase 2, mean 24-h sodium excretion was lower in the behavioral intervention than in the self-directed group (mean difference: -956.8 mg/d; 95% CI: -1538.7, -374.9 mg/d) after sodium intake at screening was controlled for (P = 0.002). These findings persisted in sensitivity analyses that excluded potentially incomplete urine collections [Mage's equation mean difference: -1090 mg/d (P = 0.001); Joosens' equation mean difference: -796 mg/d (P = 0.04)].
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A multifactorial behavioral intervention emphasizing spices and herbs significantly reduced sodium intake. Because of the ubiquity of sodium in the US food supply, multilevel strategies addressing individual behaviors and the food supply are needed to improve adherence to recommendations. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01615159.Copyright © 2015 American Society for Nutrition.

TI  - A Multicomponent Behavioral Intervention to Reduce Stroke Risk Factor Behaviors: The Stroke Health and Risk Education Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Stroke Health and Risk Education Project was a cluster-randomized, faith-based, culturally sensitive, theory-based multicomponent behavioral intervention trial to reduce key stroke risk factor behaviors in Hispanics/Latinos and European Americans.
AB  - METHODS: Ten Catholic churches were randomized to intervention or control group. The intervention group received a 1-year multicomponent intervention (with poor adherence) that included self-help materials, tailored newsletters, and motivational interviewing counseling calls. Multilevel modeling, accounting for clustering within subject pairs and parishes, was used to test treatment differences in the average change since baseline (ascertained at 6 and 12 months) in dietary sodium, fruit and vegetable intake, and physical activity, measured using standardized questionnaires. A priori, the trial was considered successful if any one of the 3 outcomes was significant at the 0.05/3 level.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 801 subjects who consented, 760 completed baseline data assessments, and of these, 86% completed at least one outcome assessment. The median age was 53 years; 84% subjects were Hispanic/Latino; and 64% subjects were women. The intervention group had a greater increase in fruit and vegetable intake than the control group (0.25 cups per day [95% confidence interval: 0.08, 0.42], P=0.002), a greater decrease in sodium intake (-123.17 mg/d [-194.76, -51.59], P=0.04), but no difference in change in moderate- or greater-intensity physical activity (-27 metabolic equivalent-minutes per week [-526, 471], P=0.56).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This multicomponent behavioral intervention targeting stroke risk factors in predominantly Hispanics/Latinos was effective in increasing fruit and vegetable intake, reaching its primary end point. The intervention also seemed to lower sodium intake. Church-based health promotions can be successful in primary stroke prevention efforts.

TI  - Effect of Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Lutein/Zeaxanthin, or Other Nutrient Supplementation on Cognitive Function: The AREDS2 Randomized Clinical Trial.
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Observational data have suggested that high dietary intake of saturated fat and low intake of vegetables may be associated with increased risk of Alzheimer disease.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the effects of oral supplementation with nutrients on cognitive function.
AB  - DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a double-masked randomized clinical trial (the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 [AREDS2]), retinal specialists in 82 US academic and community medical centers enrolled and observed participants who were at risk for developing late age-related macular degeneration (AMD) from October 2006 to December 2012. In addition to annual eye examinations, several validated cognitive function tests were administered via telephone by trained personnel at baseline and every 2 years during the 5-year study.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) (1 g) and/or lutein (10 mg)/zeaxanthin (2 mg) vs placebo were tested in a factorial design. All participants were also given varying combinations of vitamins C, E, beta carotene, and zinc.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was the yearly change in composite scores determined from a battery of cognitive function tests from baseline. The analyses, which were adjusted for baseline age, sex, race, history of hypertension, education, cognitive score, and depression score, evaluated the differences in the composite score between the treated vs untreated groups. The composite score provided an overall score for the battery, ranging from -22 to 17, with higher scores representing better function.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 89% (3741/4203) of AREDS2 participants consented to the ancillary cognitive function study and 93.6% (3501/3741) underwent cognitive function testing. The mean (SD) age of the participants was 72.7 (7.7) years and 57.5% were women. There were no statistically significant differences in change of scores for participants randomized to receive supplements vs those who were not. The yearly change in the composite cognitive function score was -0.19 (99% CI, -0.25 to -0.13) for participants randomized to receive LCPUFAs vs -0.18 (99% CI, -0.24 to -0.12) for those randomized to no LCPUFAs (difference in yearly change, -0.03 [99% CI, -0.20 to 0.13]; P=.63). Similarly, the yearly change in the composite cognitive function score was -0.18 (99% CI, -0.24 to -0.11) for participants randomized to receive lutein/zeaxanthin vs -0.19 (99% CI, -0.25 to -0.13) for those randomized to not receive lutein/zeaxanthin (difference in yearly change, 0.03 [99% CI, -0.14 to 0.19]; P=.66). Analyses were also conducted to assess for potential interactions between LCPUFAs and lutein/zeaxanthin and none were found to be significant.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among older persons with AMD, oral supplementation with LCPUFAs or lutein/zeaxanthin had no statistically significant effect on cognitive function.

TI  - Optimum and stepped care standardised antihypertensive treatment with or without renal denervation for resistant hypertension (DENERHTN): a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conflicting blood pressure-lowering effects of catheter-based renal artery denervation have been reported in patients with resistant hypertension. We compared the ambulatory blood pressure-lowering efficacy and safety of radiofrequency-based renal denervation added to a standardised stepped-care antihypertensive treatment (SSAHT) with the same SSAHT alone in patients with resistant hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: The Renal Denervation for Hypertension (DENERHTN) trial was a prospective, open-label randomised controlled trial with blinded endpoint evaluation in patients with resistant hypertension, done in 15 French tertiary care centres specialised in hypertension management. Eligible patients aged 18-75 years received indapamide 1.5 mg, ramipril 10 mg (or irbesartan 300 mg), and amlodipine 10 mg daily for 4 weeks to confirm treatment resistance by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring before randomisation. Patients were then randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either renal denervation plus an SSAHT regimen (renal denervation group) or the same SSAHT alone (control group). The randomisation sequence was generated by computer, and stratified by centres. For SSAHT, after randomisation, spironolactone 25 mg per day, bisoprolol 10 mg per day, prazosin 5 mg per day, and rilmenidine 1 mg per day were sequentially added from months two to five in both groups if home blood pressure was more than or equal to 135/85 mm Hg. The primary endpoint was the mean change in daytime systolic blood pressure from baseline to 6 months as assessed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. The primary endpoint was analysed blindly. The safety outcomes were the incidence of acute adverse events of the renal denervation procedure and the change in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline to 6 months. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01570777.
AB  - FINDINGS: Between May 22, 2012, and Oct 14, 2013, 1416 patients were screened for eligibility, 106 of those were randomly assigned to treatment (53 patients in each group, intention-to-treat population) and 101 analysed because of patients with missing endpoints (48 in the renal denervation group, 53 in the control group, modified intention-to-treat population). The mean change in daytime ambulatory systolic blood pressure at 6 months was -15.8 mm Hg (95% CI -19.7 to -11.9) in the renal denervation group and -9.9 mm Hg (-13.6 to -6.2) in the group receiving SSAHT alone, a baseline-adjusted difference of -5.9 mm Hg (-11.3 to -0.5; p=0.0329). The number of antihypertensive drugs and drug-adherence at 6 months were similar between the two groups. Three minor renal denervation-related adverse events were noted (lumbar pain in two patients and mild groin haematoma in one patient). A mild and similar decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline to 6 months was observed in both groups.
AB  - INTERPRETATION: In patients with well defined resistant hypertension, renal denervation plus an SSAHT decreases ambulatory blood pressure more than the same SSAHT alone at 6 months. This additional blood pressure lowering effect may contribute to a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity if maintained in the long term after renal denervation.

TI  - Community-based interventions in hypertensive patients: a comparison of three health education strategies.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Community-based health education programs may be helpful in improving health outcomes in patients with chronic illnesses. This study aimed to evaluate community-based health education strategies in the management of hypertensive patients with low socioeconomic status in Dongguan City, China.
AB  - METHODS: This was a randomized, non-blinded trial involving 360 hypertensive patients enrolled in the community health service centre of Liaobu Town, Dongguan City, China. Participants were randomized to receive one of the three community-based health education programs over 2 years: self-learning reading (Group 1), monthly regular didactic lecture (Group 2), monthly interactive education workshop (Group 3). Outcomes included the changes in the proportion of subjects with normalized blood pressure (BP), hypertension-related knowledge score, adherence to antihypertensive treatment, lifestyle, body mass index and serum lipids.
AB  - RESULTS: After the 2-y intervention, the proportion of subjects with normalized BP increased significantly in Group 2 (from 41.2% to 63.2%, p<0.001), and increased more substantially in Group 3 (from 40.2% to 86.3%, p<0.001), but did not change significantly in Group 1. Improvements in hypertension-related knowledge score, adherence to regular use of medications, appropriate salt intake and regular physical activity were progressively greater from group 1 to group 2 to group 3. Group 3 had the largest reductions in body mass index and serum LDL cholesterol levels.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Interactive education workshops may be the most effective strategy in community-based health promotion education programs for hypertensive patients in improving patients' knowledge on hypertension and alleviating clinical risk factors for preventing hypertension-related complications.

TI  - 12-month blood pressure results of catheter-based renal artery denervation for resistant hypertension: the SYMPLICITY HTN-3 trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Results of the SYMPLICITY HTN-3 (Renal Denervation in Patients With Uncontrolled Hypertension) trial confirmed the safety but not the efficacy of renal denervation for treatment-resistant hypertension at 6 months post procedure.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to analyze the 12-month SYMPLICITY HTN-3 results for the original denervation group, the sham subjects who underwent denervation after the 6-month endpoint (crossover group), and the sham subjects who did not undergo denervation after 6 months (non-crossover group).
AB  - METHODS: Eligible subjects were randomized 2:1 to denervation or sham procedure. Subjects were unblinded to their treatment group after the 6-month primary endpoint was ascertained; subjects in the sham group meeting eligibility requirements could undergo denervation. Change in blood pressure (BP) at 12 months post randomization (6 months for crossover subjects) was analyzed.
AB  - RESULTS: The 12-month follow-up was available for 319 of 361 denervation subjects and 48 of 101 non-crossover subjects; 6-month denervation follow-up was available for 93 of 101 crossover subjects. In denervation subjects, the 12-month office systolic BP (SBP) change was greater than that observed at 6 months (-15.5 +/- 24.1 mm Hg vs. -18.9 +/- 25.4 mm Hg, respectively; p = 0.025), but the 24-h SBP change was not significantly different at 12 months (p = 0.229). The non-crossover group office SBP decreased by -32.9 +/- 28.1 mm Hg at 6 months, but this response regressed to -21.4 +/- 19.9 mm Hg (p = 0.01) at 12 months, increasing to 11.5 +/- 29.8 mm Hg.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: These data support no further reduction in office or ambulatory BP after 1-year follow-up. Loss of BP reduction in the non-crossover group may reflect decreased medication adherence or other related factors.

TI  - One-year safety of ibuprofen/famotidine fixed combination versus ibuprofen alone: pooled analyses of two 24-week randomized, double-blind trials and a follow-on extension.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety of the fixed combination of ibuprofen and famotidine compared with ibuprofen alone from two 24-week, multicenter, double-blind trials designed to evaluate the comparative incidence of endoscopically documented upper gastrointestinal ulcers and a 28-week double-blind extension study.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Safety was analyzed by pooling data from the two double-blind trials and the follow-on study. Safety was assessed by monitoring the incidence, causality, and severity of adverse events (AEs).
AB  - RESULTS: In the pivotal efficacy and safety trials, discontinuation rates due to any cause and dyspepsia were significantly lower for the ibuprofen/famotidine combination versus ibuprofen alone. Other than dyspepsia, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular AEs of special interest were similar. Events judged to be treatment related were significantly lower with the ibuprofen/famotidine combination (20.6% vs. 25%). In the safety extension population, there were no differences in the discontinuation rates and the reporting of AEs or serious AEs (SAEs) between the two groups. Gastrointestinal-related events were similar between the groups. Incidence of cardiovascular-related AEs of special interest were 11% (ibuprofen/famotidine) and 2% (ibuprofen) (p=0.06), possibly due to a higher number of rheumatoid arthritis patients in the combination group. Of these, 80% were reports of hypertension (8% ibuprofen/famotidine vs. 2% ibuprofen). Three cases of hypertension in the ibuprofen/famotidine group were considered treatment related. The probability of a cardiovascular event decreased during days 112-167 of treatment and remained low with continued treatment.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: One-year safety data from two pivotal trials and a long-term extension study indicate that the ibuprofen/famotidine combination demonstrates a favorable gastrointestinal safety profile and more patients continued on therapy compared to ibuprofen alone. No new safety signals have been identified. These data offer additional evidence supporting a new therapeutic option to improve gastrointestinal safety and adherence for patients who require long-term ibuprofen.

TI  - Evaluating the safety and efficacy of sodium-restricted/Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet after acute decompensated heart failure hospitalization: design and rationale for the Geriatric OUt of hospital Randomized MEal Trial in Heart Failure (GOURMET-HF).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem affecting predominantly older adults. Nonadherence to diet remains a significant contributor to acute decompensated HF (ADHF). The sodium-restricted Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH/SRD) eating plan reduces cardiovascular dysfunction that can lead to ADHF and is consistent with current HF guidelines. We propose that an intervention that promotes adherence to the DASH/SRD by home-delivering meals will be safe and improve health-related quality of life (QOL) in older adults after hospitalization for ADHF.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: This is a 3-center, randomized, single-blind, controlled trial of 12-week duration designed to determine the safety and efficacy of home-delivered DASH/SRD-compliant meals in older adults after discharge from ADHF hospitalization. Sixty-six subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 stratified fashion by gender and left ventricular ejection fraction (<50% vs >50%). Study subjects will receive either preprepared, home-delivered DASH/SRD-compliant meals or usual dietary advice for 4weeks after hospital discharge. Investigators will be blinded to group assignment, food diaries, and urinary electrolyte measurements until study completion. The primary efficacy end point is the change in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire summary scores for health-related QOL from study enrollment to 4weeks postdischarge. Safety evaluation will focus on hypotension, renal insufficiency, and hyperkalemia. Exploratory end points include echocardiography, noninvasive vascular testing, markers of oxidative stress, and salt taste sensitivity.
AB  - CONCLUSION: This randomized controlled trial will test the efficacy, feasibility, and safety of 4weeks of DASH/SRD after ADHF hospitalization. By testing a novel dietary intervention supported by multiple levels of evidence including preliminary data in outpatients with stable HF, we will address a critical evidence gap in the care of older patients with ADHF. If effective and safe, this intervention could be scaled to assess effects on readmission and healthcare costs in older adults after ADHF.Copyright Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - A randomized telephone intervention trial to reduce primary medication nonadherence.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary medication nonadherence (PMN), defined as patients not picking up an initial prescription, can limit the effectiveness of therapy for chronic conditions. Effective interventions to reduce PMN have not been widely studied or implemented.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of an additional nurse-directed telephone intervention to reduce PMN in a cohort of patients with persistent nonadherence after repeated pharmacy-based outreach.
AB  - METHODS: Patients in the Geisinger Health System receiving new (i.e., initially prescribed) prescriptions sent to CVS pharmacies for medications treating asthma, hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia were identified. As part of existing programs, all patients received 2 automated and 1 live call from CVS pharmacies encouraging them to pick up their prescriptions; those who had canceled their prescriptions or had not picked them up after the 3 pharmacy interventions were eligible for this study. Patients were then randomized, and the intervention group received telephone outreach from a nursing call center to assess reasons for PMN and encourage pickup of prescriptions, with up to 3 attempts to reach each patient. Medication pickup rates were compared across the intervention and control groups.
AB  - RESULTS: Initial PMN rates in the overall population were 6%, lower than previously observed in other studies. A total of 290 patients had not picked up their prescriptions after 3 calls from the pharmacy and were enrolled in the study: 142 in the intervention group and 148 controls. The intervention did not change the rate at which patients picked up their prescriptions: 25% of intervention patients did so compared with 24% of control patients. Multivariate models adjusting for patient characteristics and medication classes did not change the results.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In a population of patients who had not picked up new prescriptions after 3 calls from the pharmacy, additional nurse-directed outreach did not improve primary medication adherence. Re-engagement with the prescribing clinician may be needed to improve adherence in this patient population. The low rate of PMN in the overall population differed from prior studies in this setting and others and should be assessed in future research.

TI  - Long-term adherence to the New Nordic Diet and the effects on body weight, anthropometry and blood pressure: a 12-month follow-up study.
AB  - PURPOSE: The New Nordic Diet (NND) has induced weight loss in a 26-week controlled intervention. We aim to investigate whether high compliance and satisfaction can be maintained after the active intervention is discontinued thereby maintaining the health effects.
AB  - METHODS: After 26 weeks of intervention with NND or Average Danish Diet (ADD), 147 participants (mean age 43 years and mean BMI 29.1 kg/m2) were followed for further 52 weeks. All participants were encouraged to follow NND but without further guidance. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, study id NCT01195610.
AB  - RESULTS: One hundred and ten participants (75%) completed the follow-up. Among participants previously randomised to NND (NND group), dietary compliance and satisfaction decreased from 4.3 to 3.0 and from 4.8 to 4.0, respectively (both p < 0.0001) (1-5 point scale). Among those originally randomised to ADD (ADD group), satisfaction with NND was significantly higher than with ADD during follow-up (3.3 vs. 2.5, p = 0.026). Weight losses during intervention of -6.2 kg and -3.0 kg were followed by regains of 4.6 kg (SE 0.5) and 1.1 kg (SE 0.7) for the NND group and ADD group, respectively [adjusted difference; mean (95 % CI): 1.8 kg (0.1-3.4), p = 0.041]. Across diet groups, every 1 score higher in compliance with NND was associated with 0.90 kg less body weight regain (p = 0.026) and those who increased physical activity regained 3.4 kg less compared to those who did not (p < 0.0001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: NND provides higher satisfaction, and body weight regain is reduced with higher compliance with NND and increased physical activity.

TI  - Impact of a community health workers-led structured program on blood glucose control among latinos with type 2 diabetes: the DIALBEST trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Latinos with type 2 diabetes (T2D) face major healthcare access and disease management disparities. We examined the impact of the Diabetes Among Latinos Best Practices Trial (DIALBEST), a community health worker (CHW)-led structured intervention for improving glycemic control among Latinos with T2D.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 211 adult Latinos with poorly controlled T2D were randomly assigned to a standard of healthcare (n = 106) or CHW (n = 105) group. The CHW intervention comprised 17 individual sessions delivered at home by CHWs over a 12-month period. Sessions addressed T2D complications, healthy lifestyles, nutrition, healthy food choices and diet for diabetes, blood glucose self-monitoring, and medication adherence. Demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, anthropometric, and biomarker (HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, and lipid profile) data were collected at baseline and 3, 6, 12, and 18 months (6 months postintervention). Groups were equivalent at baseline.
AB  - RESULTS: Participants had high HbA1c at baseline (mean 9.58% [81.2 mmol/mol]). Relative to participants in the control group, CHWs had a positive impact on net HbA1c improvements at 3 months (-0.42% [-4.62 mmol/mol]), 6 months (-0.47% [-5.10 mmol/mol]), 12 months (-0.57% [-6.18 mmol/mol]), and 18 months (-0.55% [-6.01 mmol/mol]). The overall repeated-measures group effect was statistically significant (mean difference -0.51% [-5.57 mmol/mol], 95% CI -0.83, -0.19% [-9.11, -2.03 mmol/mol], P = 0.002). CHWs had an overall significant effect on fasting glucose concentration that was more pronounced at the 12- and 18-month visits. There was no significant effect on blood lipid levels, hypertension, and weight.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: DIALBEST is an effective intervention for improving blood glucose control among Latinos with T2D.Copyright © 2015 by the American Diabetes Association.

TI  - Randomized pilot trial of intensive management of blood pressure or volume expansion in subarachnoid hemorrhage (IMPROVES).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Volume expansion and hypertension are widely used for the hemodynamic management of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility, adherence, and retention in a trial of volume expansion and blood pressure manipulation to prevent delayed cerebral ischemia.
AB  - METHODS: A randomized pilot trial using a 2-way factorial design allocating patients within 72 hours of subarachnoid hemorrhage to either normovolemia (NV) or volume expansion (HV) and simultaneously to conventional (CBP) or augmented blood pressure (ABP) for 10 days. The study endpoints were protocol adherence and retention to follow-up. The quality of endpoints for a larger trial were 6-month modified Rankin Scale score, comprehensive neurobehavioral assessment, delayed cerebral ischemia, new stroke, and discharge disposition.
AB  - RESULTS: Twenty patients were randomized and completed follow-up. The overall difference in daily mean intravenous fluid intake was 2099 mL (95% confidence interval [CI]: 867, 3333), HV vs NV group. The overall mean systolic blood pressure difference was 5 mm Hg (95% CI: -4.65, 14.75), ABP vs CBP group. Adverse events included death (n=1), delayed cerebral ischemia (n=1), and pulmonary complications (n=3). There were no differences in modified Rankin Scale score between HV and NV (difference 0.1; 95% CI: -1.26, 1.46, P=.87) or between ABP and CBP groups (-0.5, 95% CI: -1.78, 0.78, P=.43). Neuropsychological scores were similar between HV vs NV, but tended to be worse in ABP (57+/-27) vs CBP group (85+/-21, P=.04).
AB  - CONCLUSION: This pilot study showed adequate feasibility and excellent retention to follow-up. Given the suggestion of possible worse neurobehavioral outcome with ABP, a larger trial to determine the optimal blood pressure management in this patient population is warranted.

TI  - Reinforcing adherence to antihypertensive medications.
AB  - This pilot study evaluated a reinforcement intervention to improve adherence to antihypertensive therapy. Twenty-nine participants were randomized to standard care or standard care plus financial reinforcement for 12 weeks. Participants in the reinforcement group received a cell phone to self-record videos of adherence, for which they earned rewards. These participants sent videos demonstrating on-time adherence 97.8% of the time. Pill count adherence differed significantly between the groups during treatment, with 98.8%+/-1.5% of pills taken during treatment in the reinforcement condition vs 92.6%+/-9.2% in standard care (P<.002). Benefits persisted throughout a 3-month follow-up, with 93.8%+/-9.3% vs 78.0%+/-18.5% of pills taken (P<.001). Pill counts correlated significantly (P<.001) with self-reports of adherence, which also differed between groups over time (P<.01). Systolic blood pressure decreased modestly over time in participants overall (P<.01) but without significant time-by-group effects. These results suggest that reinforcing medication adherence via cellular phone technology and financial reinforcement holds potential to improve adherence.Copyright © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - The impact of health coaching on medication adherence in patients with poorly controlled diabetes, hypertension, and/or hyperlipidemia: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lack of concordance between medications listed in the medical record and taken by the patient contributes to poor outcomes. We sought to determine whether patients who received health coaching by medical assistants improved their medication concordance and adherence.
AB  - METHODS: This was a nonblinded, randomized, controlled, pragmatic intervention trial. English- or Spanish-speaking patients, age 18 to 75 years, with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and/or hyperlipidemia were enrolled from 2 urban safety net clinics and randomized to receive 12 months of health coaching versus usual care.
AB  - RESULTS: Outcomes included concordance between medications documented in the medical record and those reported by the patient and adherence based on the patient-reported number of days (of the last 7) on which patient took all prescribed medications. The proportion of medications completely concordant increased in the coached group versus the usual care group (difference in change, 10%; P = .05). The proportion of medications listed in the chart but not taken significantly decreased in the coached group compared with the usual care group (difference in change, 17%; P = .013). The mean number of adherent days increased in the coached but not in the usual care group (difference in change, 1.08; P < .001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Health coaching by medical assistants significantly increases medication concordance and adherence.© Copyright 2015 by the American Board of Family Medicine.

TI  - Randomized comparison of renal denervation versus intensified pharmacotherapy including spironolactone in true-resistant hypertension: six-month results from the Prague-15 study.
AB  - This prospective, randomized, open-label multicenter trial evaluated the efficacy of catheter-based renal denervation (Symplicity, Medtronic) versus intensified pharmacological treatment including spironolactone (if tolerated) in patients with true-resistant hypertension. This was confirmed by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring after excluding secondary hypertension and confirmation of adherence to therapy by measurement of plasma antihypertensive drug levels before enrollment. One-hundred six patients were randomized to renal denervation (n=52), or intensified pharmacological treatment (n=54) with baseline systolic blood pressure of 159+/-17 and 155+/-17 mm Hg and average number of drugs 5.1 and 5.4, respectively. A significant reduction in 24-hour average systolic blood pressure after 6 months (-8.6 [95% cofidence interval: -11.8, -5.3] mm Hg; P<0.001 in renal denervation versus -8.1 [95% cofidence interval: -12.7, -3.4] mm Hg; P=0.001 in pharmacological group) was observed, which was comparable in both groups. Similarly, a significant reduction in systolic office blood pressure (-12.4 [95% cofidence interval: -17.0, -7.8] mm Hg; P<0.001 in renal denervation versus -14.3 [95% cofidence interval: -19.7, -8.9] mm Hg; P<0.001 in pharmacological group) was present. Between-group differences in change were not significant. The average number of antihypertensive drugs used after 6 months was significantly higher in the pharmacological group (+0.3 drugs; P<0.001). A significant increase in serum creatinine and a parallel decrease of creatinine clearance were observed in the pharmacological group; between-group difference were borderline significant. The 6-month results of this study confirmed the safety of renal denervation. In conclusion, renal denervation achieved reduction of blood pressure comparable with intensified pharmacotherapy.

TI  - Effectiveness of a tailored behavioral intervention to improve hypertension control: primary outcomes of a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - UNLABELLED: Blood pressure (BP) control rates are suboptimal. We evaluated the effectiveness of 2 behavioral interventions to improve BP control via a 3-arm, randomized controlled trial of 533 adults with repeated uncontrolled BP, despite antihypertensive drug treatment for >6 months. The interventions were a tailored stage-matched intervention (SMI) or a nontailored health education intervention (HEI) of 6 monthly calls targeting diet, exercise, and medication. Control was usual care (UC). There were no baseline group differences. Baseline BP control was 42.6%, 40.6%, and 44.6% in SMI, HEI, and UC (P=0.74), respectively; systolic BP (with SEs) was 136 (0.89), 137 (1.33), and 137 (0.96) mm Hg. Six-month control was 64.6% (SMI), 54.3% (HEI), and 45.8% (UC) (P values for pairwise comparisons versus UC, 0.001 [SMI] and 0.108 [HEI]). At 6 months, systolic BP (SE) was 131.2 (1.05), 131.8 (0.99), and 134.7 (1.02) for SMI, HEI, and UC, respectively (P values for pairwise comparisons versus UC, 0.009 for SMI and 0.047 for HEI). SMI led to lower systolic BP and better BP control than UC. SMI constitutes a new, potent approach to assist patients with uncontrolled hypertension to reach BP goals.

TI  - Effects of intensive low-salt diet education on albuminuria among nondiabetic patients with hypertension treated with olmesartan: a single-blinded randomized, controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The antiproteinuric effect of a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade can be magnified by dietary salt restriction. This study sought to determine the effect of intensive low-salt diet education on BP and urine albumin excretion in nondiabetic patients with hypertension and albuminuria.
AB  - DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This study was conducted between March of 2012 and March of 2013 as an open-label, randomized, controlled trial. After a run-in period of 8 weeks, all patients received the angiotensin II receptor blocker olmesartan (40 mg daily). Patients were then divided into two groups. One group was treated for another 8 weeks with angiotensin II receptor blocker plus conventional low-salt diet education, and the other group was treated for 8 weeks with angiotensin II receptor blocker plus intensive low-salt diet education. The final analyses was performed with 245 completed patients.
AB  - RESULTS: The amount of daily albuminuria was significantly decreased from 0 (566.0 [25.0-5398.6] mg/d) to 8 weeks (282.5 [16.1-4898.5] mg/d; P<0.001). From 8 to 16 weeks, the 24-hour urinary sodium excretion was decreased by 36.0+/-5.9 mmol/d in the intensive education group and 8.8+/-4.9 mmol/d in the conventional education group (interaction P<0.001). Patients who completed intensive low-salt diet education exhibited greater decreases in urinary albumin excretion than the control group (change in albuminuria from 8 to 16 weeks, -154.0 versus 0.4 mg/d; P=0.01). Urinary albumin excretion tended to decrease as the 24-hour urinary sodium excretion amount decreased (R=0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.20 to 0.43; P<0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The 24-hour urinary albumin excretion was decreased more in patients in the intensive low-salt diet education group than patients in the conventional education group. Weekly intensive education on a low-salt diet would be a suitable method for clinical practice.Copyright © 2014 by the American Society of Nephrology.

TI  - Rationale and design of a randomized controlled trial evaluating community health worker-based interventions for the secondary prevention of acute coronary syndromes in India (SPREAD).
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a need to evaluate and implement cost-effective strategies to improve adherence to treatments in coronary heart disease. There are no studies from low- to middle income countries (LMICs) evaluating trained community health worker (CHW)-based interventions for the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease.
AB  - METHODS: We designed a hospital-based, open randomized trial of CHW-based interventions versus standard care. Patients after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were randomized to an intervention group (a CHW-based intervention package, comprising education tools to enhance self-care and adherence, and regular follow-up by the CHW) or to standard care for 12 months during which study outcomes were recorded. The CHWs were trained over a period of 6 months. The primary outcome measure was medication adherence. The secondary outcomes were differences in adherence to lifestyle modification, physiological parameters (blood pressure [BP], body weight, body mass index [BMI], heart rate, lipids), and major adverse cardiovascular events.
AB  - RESULTS: We recruited 806 patients stabilized after an ACS from 14 hospitals in 13 Indian cities. The mean age was 56.4 (+/- 11.32) years, and 17.2% were females. A high prevalence of risk factors such as hypertension (43.4%), diabetes (31.9%), tobacco consumption (35.4%), and inadequate physical activity (70.5%) was documented. A little over half had ST-elevation myocardial infarction (53.7%), and 46.3% had non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The CHW interventions and training for SPREAD have been developed and adapted for local use. The results and experience of this study will be important to counter the burden of cardiovascular diseases in low- to middle income countries.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Characteristics, management modalities and outcome in chronic systolic heart failure patients treated in tertiary care centers: results from the EVIdence based TreAtment in Heart Failure (EVITA-HF) registry.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited data exist regarding baseline characteristics and management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (EF) in tertiary care facilities.
AB  - METHODS: EVITA-HF comprises web-based case report data on demography, comorbidities, diagnostic and therapy measures, quality of life, adverse events and 1-year follow-up of patients hospitalized for chronic heart failure and an ejection fraction of less than 40%.
AB  - RESULTS: Between February 2009 and June 2011, a total of 1,853 consecutive, hospitalized patients (pts) were included in 16 centers in Germany. Mean age was 70 years, 76% were male. Median EF was 30%, and 63% were in NYHA III/IV. Ischemic cardiomyopathy was present in 56%, history of hypertension in 76%, diabetes in 39%, impaired renal function in 33%, thyroid dysfunction in 12%, and malignoma in 7%. Sixty-eight percent of pts had a non-elective admission. Rhythm was sinus/atrial fibrillation or flutter/pacemaker in 64, 28 and 11%, respectively. Median heart rate amounted to 80 bpm, median blood pressure to 122/74 mmHg. LBBB was present in 26% of non-pacemaker pts. Eighteen percent had an ICD or CRT-D. Medication (admission vs. discharge) consisted of ACEI or ARB in 73 vs. 88%, beta-blocker in 71 vs. 89%, mineral corticosteroid receptor antagonist (MRA) in 32 vs. 57%, diuretics in 68 vs. 83% (p < 0.001 for each). Forty-two percent of pts received a specific treatment procedure beyond pharmacotherapy, of these 48% revascularization, 39% device therapy, 14% electrical cardioversion, 5% ablation procedures, 9 % valvular procedures, 6% iv inotropes, 1.8% IABP or LVAD implantation. At discharge, 33% of survivors had ICD- or CRT-D implants. One-year mortality amounted to 16.8%, and death or rehospitalization to 56%. NYHA class III/IV was found in 30% (p < 0.001 vs. index admission), general health status was improved in 45% and unchanged in 36% of patients. Eighty-five percent of pts took ACEI or ARB, 86% beta-blockers, 47% MRA, and 78% diuretics (p < 0.001 vs. index discharge for all).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Patients with chronic heart failure and low ejection fraction represent an elderly and multimorbid population. While hospitalized, they experience a significant optimization of prognosis-relevant medication, revascularization and device therapy. After 1 year, mortality is moderate; drug adherence is high and NYHA status favourable. The EVITA-HF registry is able to reflect coherently the real-world management, efforts and follow-up in heart failure pts managed in tertiary care facilities.

TI  - Safety and adherence of Umezu polyphenols in the Japanese plum (Prunus mume) in a 12-week double-blind randomized placebo-controlled pilot trial to evaluate antihypertensive effects.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Medications or lifestyle changes to prevent or improve hypertension often press considerable efforts on patients suffering from mild hypertension. Capsules including Umezu polyphenols (UP), polyphenols in Japanese plums, may help them to control their blood pressure (BP). The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of UP on BP and its safety.
AB  - METHODS: A total of 15 healthy workers without antihypertensive medication who had some concerns about their BP, preferably normal-high BP or hypertension level 1, were randomized in a double-blind manner into UP ingesting and placebo groups. Each subject was instructed to take four capsules daily for 12 weeks (daily UP dose, 800 mg for the UP ingesting group; and 0 mg for the placebo group). These subjects were followed for 12 weeks, and their BP both at home and at the examination site, as well as self-perceived quality-of-life outcomes and possible side effects, was monitored during that period. Group x time interactions on BP changes were examined.
AB  - RESULTS: All of the 15 subjects completed the 12-week intervention trial. The BP changes did not significantly differ between the UP ingesting and placebo groups, neither at the examination site nor at home. But during the study period, no adverse effects were observed.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: No remarkable effect of UP on BP was observed. However, a higher dose of UP was confirmed safe and high in adherence in this 12-week randomized controlled trial. Its effect on BP and other outcomes shall be confirmed in a larger sample.

TI  - Randomized controlled trial of a multipronged intervention to improve blood pressure control among stroke survivors in Nigeria.
AB  - RATIONALE: Stroke is the second-leading cause of death in low- and middle-income countries, but use of evidence-based therapies for stroke prevention in such countries, especially those in Africa, is extremely poor. This study is designed to enhance the implementation and sustainability of secondary stroke-preventive services following hospital discharge.
AB  - AIM/HYPOTHESIS: The primary study aim is to test whether a Chronic Care Model-based initiative entitled the Tailored Hospital-based Risk reduction to Impede Vascular Events after Stroke (THRIVES) significantly improves blood pressure control after stroke.
AB  - DESIGN: This prospective triple-blind randomized controlled trial will include a cohort of 400 patients with a recent stroke discharged from four medical care facilities in Nigeria. The culturally sensitive, system-appropriate intervention comprises patient report cards, phone text messaging, an educational video, and coordination of posthospitalization care.
AB  - STUDY OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is improvement of blood pressure control. Secondary endpoints include control of other stroke risk factors, medication adherence, functional status, and quality of life. We will also perform a cost analysis of THRIVES from the viewpoint of government policy-makers.
AB  - DISCUSSION: We anticipate that a successful intervention will serve as a scalable model of effective postdischarge chronic blood pressure management for stroke in sub-Saharan Africa and possibly for other symptomatic cardiovascular disease entities in the region.Copyright © 2014 World Stroke Organization.

TI  - Home BP monitoring using a telemonitoring system is effective for controlling BP in a remote island in Japan.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess whether a home blood pressure (HBP) telemonitoring system could improve BP control and overcome the problems of HBP monitoring in a remote location. The authors enrolled 60 subjects and randomized them to either a Telemonitoring group or a Control group. The outcomes were changes in HBP level, adherence to HBP monitoring, and visual analog scale (VAS; score 0-100) as a measure of the motivation to perform HBP measurements. The reductions in morning systolic BP (-5.5 +/- 0.9 mm Hg vs 0.7 +/- 0.7 mm Hg, P < .001) and evening systolic BP (-4.6 +/- 1.0 mm Hg vs 1.0 +/- 1.1 mm Hg, P < .001) and the change in VAS (12.8 +/- 3.3 vs -1.6 +/- 2.2, P = .001) were significantly greater in the Telemonitoring group than in the Control group. The measure of the adherence to HBP monitoring tended to be better (P = .064) in the Telemonitoring group than in the Control group. These results indicate that an HBP telemonitoring system would be a beneficial healthcare measure in remote geographical locations.Copyright ©2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - CPAP treatment supported by telemedicine does not improve blood pressure in high cardiovascular risk OSA patients: a randomized, controlled trial.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been associated with hypertension, which is one of the intermediary mechanisms leading to increased cardiovascular morbidity. This study aimed at evaluating the effects of a combination of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and telemedicine support on blood pressure (BP) reduction in high cardiovascular risk OSA patients.
AB  - DESIGN: A multi-center randomized controlled trial that compared standard CPAP care and CPAP care and a telemedicine intervention.
AB  - SETTING: Sleep clinics in France.
AB  - PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: 107 adult (18-65 years old) OSA patients (AHI > 15 events/h) with a high cardiovascular risk (cardiovascular SCORE > 5% or secondary prevention).
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to either standard care CPAP (n = 53) or CPAP and telemedicine (n = 54). Patients assigned to telemedicine were equipped with a smartphone for uploading BP measurements, CPAP adherence, sleepiness, and quality of life data; in return, they received pictograms containing health-related messages.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: The main outcome was home self-measured BP and secondary outcomes were cardiovascular risk evolution, objective physical activity, CPAP adherence, sleepiness and quality of life.
AB  - RESULTS: Self-measured BP did not improve in either group (telemedicine or standard care). Patients in primary prevention showed greater BP reduction with CPAP treatment than those in secondary prevention.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: CPAP treatment supported by telemedicine alone did not improve blood pressure and cardiovascular risk in high cardiovascular risk OSA patients. This study emphasizes the need for diet and physical activity training programs in addition to CPAP when aiming at decreasing cardiometabolic risk factors in these patients.

TI  - Multicentre randomised controlled study comparing carvedilol with variceal band ligation in the prevention of variceal rebleeding.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Rebleeding after an initial oesophageal variceal haemorrhage remains a significant problem despite therapy with band ligation, non-selective beta-blockers or a combination of these. Carvedilol is a vasodilating non-selective beta-blocker with alpha-1 receptor and calcium channel antagonism. A recent study has suggested it is effective in the prevention of a first variceal bleed. Our aim was to compare oral carvedilol with variceal band ligation (VBL) in the prevention of rebleeding following a first variceal bleed.
AB  - METHODS: Patients who were stable 5 days after presentation with a first oesophageal variceal haemorrhage and had not been taking beta-blockers were randomised to oral carvedilol or VBL. Patients were followed-up after one week, monthly, then every 3 months. The primary end point was variceal rebleeding on intention-to-treat analysis.
AB  - RESULTS: 64 patients were randomised, 33 to carvedilol and 31 to VBL. 58 (90.6%) patients had alcohol related liver disease. Age and Child-Pugh score were similar in both groups at baseline. Median follow-up was 26.3 (interquartile range [IQR] 10.2-46.6)months. Compliance was 68% and 65% for carvedilol and VBL respectively (p=0.993) and serious adverse events between the two groups were similar (p=0.968). Variceal rebleeding occurred during follow-up in 12 (36.4%) and 11 (35.5%) patients in the carvedilol and VBL groups, respectively (p=0.857), with 9 (27.3%) and 16 (51.6%) deaths in each group, respectively (p=0.110).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Carvedilol is not superior to VBL in the prevention of variceal rebleeding. The trend to a survival benefit for patients taking this drug compared with those undergoing banding requires further exploration.Copyright © 2014 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

TI  - Self-monitoring of blood pressure for improving adherence to antihypertensive medicines and blood pressure control: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Self-monitoring is reported to have limited efficacy for hypertension management in high-income countries. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of self-monitoring on blood pressure (BP) control in an Iranian population.
AB  - METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted on 196 mild to moderate hypertensive patients in an outpatient cardiovascular clinic. Patients in the intervention group received a wrist self-monitoring device and were educated to measure and document their BP daily during the study period (24 weeks). Patients in the control group received usual care. Three follow-up visits with the physician were scheduled for all patients (weeks 4, 12, and 24), and the investigator assessed adherence to medications after each visit (pill counting). The primary outcome (BP) was compared between groups using repeated-measure analysis of variance.
AB  - RESULTS: One hundred ninety patients completed the study. Systolic BP (144.4+/-7.4 vs 145.9+/-6.4mm Hg) and diastolic BP (85.5+/-6.9 vs. 85.1+/-7.7mm Hg) were similar between groups at baseline. The trend of BP was not significantly different between groups during the study period. Systolic and diastolic BP decreased significantly in both groups at the first follow-up visit (systolic BP: 132.6 vs. 133.4mm Hg; diastolic BP: 77.4 vs. 77.2mm Hg). In the intervention group, we observed a small continued decrease in diastolic BP up to week 24 BP (P = 0.01). Both groups showed adherence rates >95% during the study period.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Our study could not confirm that self-monitoring can improve BP control in patients with frequent medical visits.Copyright © American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd 2014. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.

TI  - Effects of DASH diet on lipid profiles and biomarkers of oxidative stress in overweight and obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a randomized clinical trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on lipid profiles and biomarkers of oxidative stress in overweight and obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
AB  - METHODS: This randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted with 48 women diagnosed with PCOS. The women were randomly assigned to consume either the control (n = 24) or DASH diet (n = 24) for 8 wk. Both diets were designed to be calorie-restricted. Both diets consisted of 52% carbohydrates, 18% proteins, and 30% total fats. The DASH diet was designed to be rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products and to be low in saturated fats, cholesterol, and refined grains. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after 8-wk intervention to measure lipid profiles and biomarkers of oxidative stress including plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and total glutathione (GSH).
AB  - RESULTS: Adherence to the DASH diet, compared with the control diet, resulted in a significant decrease in weight (-4.4 versus -1.5 kg; P < 0.001) and body mass index (-1.7 versus -0.6 kg/m(2); P < 0.001), decreased serum triglycerides (-10.0 versus +19.2 mg/dL; P interaction = 0.005) and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (-2.0 versus +3.9 mg/dL; P interaction = 0.005). Increased concentrations of TAC (+98.6 versus -174.8 mmol/L; P interaction <0.001) and GSH (+66.4 versus -155.6 mumol/L; P interaction = 0.005) also were found in the DASH group compared with the control group.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Consumption of DASH diet for 8 wk led to a significant reduction in serum insulin, triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a significant increase in TAC and GSH levels.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Rationale, design, and implementation of a cluster randomized trial using certified diabetes educators to intensify treatment for glycemia, blood pressure and lipid control: REMEDIES 4D.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence supports that adequate treatment of hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension can reduce morbidity and mortality in people with diabetes, however achieving treatment goals remains elusive. The majority of diabetes care occurs in the primary care setting; however there are often missed opportunities for timely intervention during office visits. This paper describes a systematic redesign of current diabetes treatment in primary care by implementing evidence-based protocols.
AB  - MATERIALS/METHODS: This is a cluster randomized controlled trial using certified diabetes educators (CDEs) to intensify therapeutic management. Fifteen primary care practices from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center were recruited. Practices were randomized to intervention (implementation of diabetes management protocols) or usual care. Eligibility criteria included diagnosis of type 2 diabetes at least one year prior to baseline and an A1C > 7%, LDLc > 100 mg/dl or blood pressure > 130/80 mmHg which were the goal levels established by the American Diabetes Association at study inception. Treatment was intensified according to preapproved protocols. Participants also received diabetes education during their visits. Research assessments were done at baseline, three, six and twelve months. Clinical visits were scheduled between research visits, as needed, to adjust medications. Primary outcomes were achievement of glycemic, blood pressure, or lipid control goals. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, medication and diabetes care satisfaction, medication adherence, and cost-effectiveness.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study will provide the evidence to support expanded roles for CDEs in primary care. Using this model to deliver diabetes care may offer a more cost-effective approach for diabetes management.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Study protocol of EMPOWER participatory action research (EMPOWER-PAR): a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial of multifaceted chronic disease management strategies to improve diabetes and hypertension outcomes in primary care.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic disease management presents enormous challenges to the primary care workforce because of the rising epidemic of cardiovascular risk factors. The chronic care model was proven effective in improving chronic disease outcomes in developed countries, but there is little evidence of its effectiveness in developing countries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the EMPOWER-PAR intervention (multifaceted chronic disease management strategies based on the chronic care model) in improving outcomes for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension using readily available resources in the Malaysian public primary care setting. This paper presents the study protocol.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: A pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial using participatory action research is underway in 10 public primary care clinics in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Five clinics were randomly selected to provide the EMPOWER-PAR intervention for 1 year and another five clinics continued with usual care. Each clinic consecutively recruits type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension patients fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria over a 2-week period. The EMPOWER-PAR intervention consists of creating/strengthening a multidisciplinary chronic disease management team, training the team to use the Global Cardiovascular Risks Self-Management Booklet to support patient care and reinforcing the use of relevant clinical practice guidelines for management and prescribing. For type 2 diabetes mellitus, the primary outcome is the change in the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c<6.5%. For hypertension without type 2 diabetes mellitus, the primary outcome is the change in the proportion of patients achieving blood pressure <140/90 mmHg. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients achieving targets for serum lipid profile, body mass index and waist circumference. Other outcome measures include medication adherence levels, process of care and prescribing patterns. Patients' assessment of their chronic disease care and providers' perceptions, attitudes and perceived barriers in care delivery and cost-effectiveness of the intervention are also evaluated.
AB  - DISCUSSION: Results from this study will provide objective evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention based on the chronic care model in resource-constrained public primary care settings. The evidence should instigate crucial primary care system change in Malaysia.

TI  - A multifaceted pharmacist intervention to improve antihypertensive adherence: a cluster-randomized, controlled trial (HAPPy trial).
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVES: About half of all patients taking antihypertensives discontinue treatment by 12 months. There is potential for substantial health gains at both individual and population levels through improved treatment adherence. The objective was to evaluate a community pharmacist intervention to improve adherence with antihypertensive medicines with a view to improving blood pressure (BP) control.
AB  - METHODS:
AB  - DESIGN: prospective, non-blinded, cluster-randomized, controlled trial.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: adults with primary hypertension who obtained antihypertensives in the previous 6 months. Patients with poor refill adherence were preferentially identified with the help of a purpose-built software application.
AB  - INTERVENTION: package comprising BP monitor; training on BP self-monitoring; motivational interviewing; medication use review; prescription refill reminders.
AB  - FOLLOW-UP: six months.
AB  - PRIMARY OUTCOME: change in proportion self-reporting medication adherence. Secondary outcome: BP changes.
AB  - RESULTS: Participants (n = 395; intervention - 207; control - 188) had a mean age of 66.7 years; 51.1% were males. The proportion of adherent participants increased in both groups but was not significantly different between groups [57.2% to 63.6% (control) vs. 60.0% to 73.5% (intervention), P = 0.23]. The mean reduction in systolic BP was significantly greater in the intervention group (10.0 mmHg vs. 4.6 mmHg; P = 0.05). The proportion of patients who were non-adherent at baseline and adherent at 6 months was 22.6% (95%CI 5.1-40.0%) higher in the intervention group (61.8% vs. 39.2%, P = 0.007). Among participants with baseline BP above target, reduction of systolic BP was significantly greater in the intervention group [by 7.2 mmHg (95%CI 1.6-12.8 mmHg); (P = 0.01)]. Among participants non-adherent at baseline and above target BP, the proportion reporting adherence at 6 months was significantly greater in the intervention group [56.8% vs. 35.9%, P = 0.039).
AB  - WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: This community pharmacist intervention resulted in improved adherence to antihypertensive medication and reduced systolic BP.Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Relationships among stressful life events and physiological markers, treatment adherence, and psychosocial functioning among youth with type 2 diabetes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationships between stressful life events and physiological measures, adherence to prescribed oral medication regimens, depressive symptoms, and impaired quality of life (QoL) in adolescents with recent-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D).
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Data were collected from 497 ethnically diverse participants (66% female) in the final year of the Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth multicenter clinical trial. Exposure to 32 possible events over the previous year and rating of subsequent distress were collected by self-report and summarized as a major stressors score. This score was analyzed for relationship to glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c and treatment failure), body mass index, diagnosis of hypertension or triglyceride dyslipidemia, adherence to a prescribed oral medication regimen, presence of depressive symptoms, and impaired QoL.
AB  - RESULTS: The total number of major stressful life events in the adolescents with T2D was calculated, with 33% reporting none, 67% reporting > 1, 47% reporting > 2, 33% reporting > 3, and 20% reporting > 4. There were no associations between the major stressors score and physiological measures or diagnosis of comorbidities. The odds of medication nonadherence increased significantly from those reporting > 1 major stressor (OR, 1.58; P = .0265) to those reporting > 4 major stressors (OR, 2.70; P = .0009). Significant odds of elevated depressive symptoms and impaired QoL were also found with increased reporting of major stressors.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Exposure to major stressful life events is associated with lower adherence to prescribed oral medication regimens and impaired psychosocial functioning in adolescents with T2D.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The effect of a community-based self-help multimodal behavioral intervention in Korean American seniors with high blood pressure.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Great strides have been made in improving heart health in the United States during the last 2 decades, yet these strides have not encompassed many ethnic minority populations. There are significant health disparity gaps stemming from both a paucity of valid research and a lack of culturally sensitive interventions. In particular, many Korean Americans with chronic illnesses encounter difficulty navigating the healthcare system because of limited health literacy.
AB  - METHODS: The effect of a multimodal Self-Help Intervention Program on the Control of High Blood Pressure (HBP) was tested in a community-based clinical trial for Korean American seniors. Of 440 seniors enrolled, 369 completed the study (184 in the intervention group and 185 in the control group; mean age = 70.9+/-5.3 years). The intervention group received 6 weekly educational sessions on HBP management skill building, including health literacy training, followed by telephone counseling and home blood pressure (BP) monitoring for 12 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Findings support that the Self-Help Intervention Program on the Control of HBP was effective in controlling BP in this ethnic/linguistic minority population. The BP control rates for the intervention and control groups were 49.5% vs. 43.2% at baseline, 58.5% vs. 42.4% at 6 months, 67.9% vs. 52.5% at 12 months, and 54.3% vs. 53.0% at 18 months. Significant changes were observed over time in some psychobehavioral outcomes, including self-efficacy for BP control, medication adherence behavior, HBP knowledge, and depression.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The study findings suggest that the multimodal Self-Help Intervention Program on the Control of HBP is effective at promoting optimal HBP control for this ethnic/linguistic minority population.

TI  - Effect of a low-fat or low-carbohydrate weight-loss diet on markers of cardiovascular risk among premenopausal women: a randomized trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low-fat and low-carbohydrate weight-loss diets can have a beneficial effect on longitudinal measures of blood pressure and blood lipids. We aimed to assess longitudinal changes in blood pressure and blood lipids in a population of premenopausal women. We hypothesized that results may differ by level of adherence to the respective diet protocol and baseline presence of hypertension or hyperlipidemia.
AB  - METHODS: Overweight or obese premenopausal women were randomized to a low-fat (n=41) or low-carbohydrate (n=38) diet. As part of the 52-week Lifestyle Eating and Fitness (LEAF) intervention trial, we fit linear mixed models to determine whether a change in outcome differed by treatment arm.
AB  - RESULTS: Within-group trends in blood pressure and blood lipids did not differ (p>0.30). Across study arms, there was a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP, 3mm Hg, p=0.01) over time, but diastolic blood pressure (DBP) did not change significantly over the course of the study. Blood lipids (total cholesterol [TC], low-density lipoproteins [LDL], and high-density lipoproteins [HDL]) all exhibited nonlinear trends over time (p<0.01); each decreased initially but returned to levels comparable to baseline by study conclusion (p>0.20). We observed a decline in SBP among women who were hypertensive at baseline (p<0.01), but hypercholesterolemia at baseline did not affect trends in blood lipids (p>0.40).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Our results support that dietary interventions may be efficacious for lowering blood pressure and blood lipids among overweight or obese premenopausal women. However, a decrease in SBP was the only favorable change that was sustained in this study population. These changes can be maintained over the course of a 1-year intervention, yet changes in blood lipids may be less sustainable.

TI  - Aliskiren alone or with other antihypertensives in the elderly with borderline and stage 1 hypertension: the APOLLO trial.
AB  - AIMS: We studied the unclear question whether blood pressure (BP) lowering reduces cardiovascular disease (CVD) in elderly individuals with systolic BP <160 mm Hg.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: We initiated a randomized placebo-controlled stratified 2 x 2 factorial clinical trial evaluating the effects of BP lowering in 11 000 elderly individuals with systolic blood pressure (SBP) between 130 and 159 mm Hg, for 5 years. Following 5-week active run-in, participants were randomized to aliskiren (300 mg) or placebo, and to an additional antihypertensive [hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg) or amlodipine (5 mg)], or their respective placeboes. Study was terminated by sponsor after 1759 subjects (age 72.1 +/- 5.2 years, 88% receiving at least one antihypertensive) were randomized and followed for 0.6 year. Study drugs were well tolerated with few serious adverse events during run-in and after randomization, with no significant differences between treatment groups. By design, three levels of BP reductions were achieved, adjusted mean BP reductions of 3.5/1.7 mm Hg (P < 0.001) by aliskiren, 6.8/3.3 mm Hg (P < 0.001) by hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine, and 10.3/5.0 mm Hg (P < 0.001) by double therapy compared with placebo. Twenty-five major CVD events occurred. Non-significant trends towards fewer CVD events with greater BP reductions are evident: hazard ratios (HR) 0.82 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.37-1.81] for 3.5 mm Hg SBP reduction; HR 0.45 (95% CI: 0.19-1.04) for 6.8 mm Hg; and HR 0.25 (0.05-1.18) for 10.3 mm Hg reduction for primary composite of CV death, MI, stroke, or significant heart failure.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Sizeable reductions in BP, with potential for substantial CVD reduction, can be safely achieved using combinations of BP drugs in the elderly with normal high and Stage 1 hypertension.

TI  - Effects on office and home blood pressure of the lercanidipine-enalapril combination in patients with Stage 2 hypertension: a European randomized, controlled clinical trial.[Erratum appears in J Hypertens. 2014 Oct;32(10):2106]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combinations of lercanidipine (L) and enalapril (E) at different doses on office and home blood pressure (BP) in patients with Stage 2 hypertension.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, factorial study conducted in 100 centres from seven countries. Patients with office DBP 100-109 mmHg and home DBP at least 85 mmHg at the end of a 2-week placebo run-in period were randomized to a 10-week treatment with placebo, L (10 or 20 mg), E (10 or 20 mg) or the four L-E combinations. The efficacy parameters were office DBP at trough (primary), SBP at trough and home SBP and DBP. Office BP was measured at each visit in both the sitting and the standing position, while home BP was measured twice in the morning and twice in the evening for at least 3 days before treatment and at study end. Safety parameters included adverse events, laboratory tests and 12-lead ECG.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 1039 patients were randomized (48% men, mean age 54 years, mean BMI 30 kg/m, 40% obese patients). Baseline BP was similar in all groups and lower for home than for office values (149/95 and 159/103 mmHg, respectively). A marked placebo effect was observed on office but not on home BP. Combination therapy was superior to placebo at all doses for both office and home BP. The greatest effect was observed in the L20/E20 group, in which the SBP/DBP fall amounted to -19.2/-15.2 and -13.2/-7.5 mmHg for sitting office and home BP, respectively. Similar reductions were observed on standing office BP. The L20/E20 combination was associated with less cough, palpitations and leg oedema than monotherapies, with no increased rate of dizziness or hypotension.
AB  - CONCLUSION: In Stage 2 hypertension, a fixed-dose combination of L and E ensures a control of both office and out-of-office BP, with a favourable tolerability profile.

TI  - The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet affects inflammation in childhood metabolic syndrome: a randomized cross-over clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effects of the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet on inflammation in childhood metabolic syndrome (MetS) have still to be identified.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of the DASH diet on markers of systemic inflammation in adolescents with MetS.
AB  - METHODS: In this randomized, cross-over clinical trial, 60 postpubescent girls with MetS were randomly assigned to receive either the DASH diet menu cycles or usual dietary advice (UDA) for 6 weeks. After a 4-week washout period, participants were crossed over to the alternate arm. The DASH diet was designed to maintain the current body weight. This diet contained high amounts of fruit, vegetables and low-fat dairy products and was low in saturated fats and cholesterol. UDA consisted of general oral advice and written information about healthy food choices based on the Healthy Eating Plate. Compliance to the DASH diet was assessed through quantification of plasma vitamin C levels. Fasting venous blood samples were taken 4 times from each participant: at baseline and at the end of each study arm. Circulating levels of biomarkers of systemic inflammation were quantified according to standard protocols.
AB  - RESULTS: Mean (SD) age and weight of participants was 14.2 years (1.7) and 69 kg (14.5), respectively. Serum vitamin C levels tended to increase during the DASH phase compared with the UDA phase (16.8 +/- 12.9 vs. -13.8 +/- 9.7 ng/dl, respectively, p = 0.06) indicating a relatively good compliance to the DASH diet. Adherence to the DASH diet, compared to the UDA, had a significant effect on serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (p = 0.002). This effect remained significant even after adjustment for weight changes and after further controlling for changes in lipid profiles. We did not observe any significant effect of intervention on levels of serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6 and adiponectin, in either the crude or adjusted models. There were no significant group*time interactions for any dependent variable, except for IL-6; this was close to the significant level.
AB  - CONCLUSION: In summary, consumption of the DASH eating pattern for 6 weeks may reduce circulating levels of hs-CRP among adolescents with MetS. Other inflammatory markers were not affected by the DASH diet.

TI  - A cluster-randomized trial of task shifting and blood pressure control in Ghana: study protocol.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are experiencing an epidemic of cardiovascular disease (CVD) propelled by rapidly increasing rates of hypertension. Barriers to hypertension control in SSA include poor access to care and high out-of-pocket costs. Although SSA bears 24% of the global disease burden, it has only 3% of the global health workforce. Given such limited resources, cost-effective strategies, such as task shifting, are needed to mitigate the rising CVD epidemic in SSA. Ghana, a country in SSA with an established community health worker program integrated within a national health insurance scheme provides an ideal platform to evaluate implementation of the World Health Organization (WHO) task-shifting strategy. This study will evaluate the comparative effectiveness of the implementation of the WHO Package targeted at CV risk assessment versus provision of health insurance coverage, on blood pressure (BP) reduction.
AB  - METHODS: Using a cluster randomized design, 32 community health centers (CHCs) and district hospitals in Ghana will be randomized to either the intervention group (16 CHCs) or the control group (16 CHCs). A total of 640 patients with uncomplicated hypertension (BP 140-179/90-99 mm Hg and absence of target organ damage) will be enrolled in this study (20 patients per CHC). The intervention consists of WHO Package of CV risk assessment, patient education, initiation and titration of antihypertensive medications, behavioral counseling on lifestyle behaviors, and medication adherence every three months for 12 months. The primary outcome is the mean change in systolic BP from baseline to 12 months. The secondary outcomes are rates of BP control at 12 months; levels of physical activity, percent change in weight, and dietary intake of fruits and vegetables at 12 months; and sustainability of intervention effects at 24 months. All outcomes will be assessed at baseline, six months and 12 months. Trained community health nurses will deliver the intervention as part of Ghana's community-based health planning and services (CHPS) program.
AB  - DISCUSSION: Findings from this study will provide policy makers and other stakeholders needed information to recommend scalable and cost-effective policy with respect to comprehensive CV risk reduction and hypertension control in resource-poor settings.

TI  - Youth-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus: lessons learned from the TODAY study.
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasingly diagnosed in obese children and adolescents. Evidence suggests that this disease commonly progresses more rapidly in youth compared with adults and is associated with high rates of early microalbuminuria, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) study was the first multiethnic, multicenter randomized trial in the United States to compare 3 treatment approaches in obese youth with new-onset type 2 diabetes (n=699; ages 10-17 years): monotherapy with metformin, metformin with rosiglitazone, and metformin with an intensive lifestyle intervention. The primary outcome was glycemic control. Diabetes-related complications and cardiovascular risk factors were also examined. Approximately half of the participants could not maintain glycemic control by using metformin alone. Combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone resulted in better durability of glycemic control, and metformin plus intensive lifestyle intervention was intermediate but not superior to metformin alone. Deterioration in glycemic control was associated with rapid loss of beta cell function, not worsened insulin sensitivity, and could not be explained by differences in adherence or body mass index. After 3.9 years, 236 (33.8%) of participants had hypertension and 116 participants (16.6%) had microalbuminuria. Only 55.9% of participants had a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level less than 100 mg/dL (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259) after 3 years, and 71 of 517 participants (13.7%) had retinopathy. The significance of the findings from this important trial for the management of youth and young adults with youth-onset type 2 diabetes and its complications is discussed. An aggressive multifaceted approach is needed to prevent or forestall premature microvascular and macrovascular complications in youth-onset type 2 diabetes.

TI  - CPAP versus oxygen in obstructive sleep apnea.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with hypertension, inflammation, and increased cardiovascular risk. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) reduces blood pressure, but adherence is often suboptimal, and the benefit beyond management of conventional risk factors is uncertain. Since intermittent hypoxemia may underlie cardiovascular sequelae of sleep apnea, we evaluated the effects of nocturnal supplemental oxygen and CPAP on markers of cardiovascular risk.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted a randomized, controlled trial in which patients with cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors were recruited from cardiology practices. Patients were screened for obstructive sleep apnea with the use of the Berlin questionnaire, and home sleep testing was used to establish the diagnosis. Participants with an apnea-hypopnea index of 15 to 50 events per hour were randomly assigned to receive education on sleep hygiene and healthy lifestyle alone (the control group) or, in addition to education, either CPAP or nocturnal supplemental oxygen. Cardiovascular risk was assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks of the study treatment. The primary outcome was 24-hour mean arterial pressure.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 318 patients who underwent randomization, 281 (88%) could be evaluated for ambulatory blood pressure at both baseline and follow-up. On average, the 24-hour mean arterial pressure at 12 weeks was lower in the group receiving CPAP than in the control group (-2.4 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], -4.7 to -0.1; P=0.04) or the group receiving supplemental oxygen (-2.8 mm Hg; 95% CI, -5.1 to -0.5; P=0.02). There was no significant difference in the 24-hour mean arterial pressure between the control group and the group receiving oxygen. A sensitivity analysis performed with the use of multiple imputation approaches to assess the effect of missing data did not change the results of the primary analysis.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In patients with cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors, the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea with CPAP, but not nocturnal supplemental oxygen, resulted in a significant reduction in blood pressure.

TI  - Taste acceptability of pulverized brand-name and generic drugs containing amlodipine or candesartan.
AB  - Trials with pulverized brand-name antihypertensive drugs suggest that, from the perspective of taste acceptability, crushed candesartan, chlortalidon, hydrochlorothiazide, lercanidipine and lisinopril should be preferred to pulverized amlodipine, atenolol, bisoprolol, enalapril, irbesartan, losartan, ramipril, telmisartan and valsartan. Brand-name antihypertensive drugs and the corresponding generic medicines have never been compared with respect to their taste acceptability. We therefore investigated among healthy health care workers the taste acceptability of a pulverized 1 mg-test dose of the brand-name and two generics containing either the dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker amlodipine (Norvasc(), Amlodipin-Mepha() and Amlodipin Pfizer()) or the angiotensin receptor antagonist candesartan (Atacand(), Cansartan-Mepha() and Pemzek()). For this purpose, a smiley-face scale depicting four degrees of pleasure was used. Between November and December 2013, the taste test was performed among 19 nurses (15 female and 4 male subjects) and 12 physicians (5 female and 7 male subjects) aged between 25 and 49 years. Pulverized brand-names and generics containing either amlodipine or candesartan did not differ with respect to their taste acceptability.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Perceived discrimination and medication adherence in black hypertensive patients: the role of stress and depression.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between perceived discrimination and medication adherence among black people with hypertension and the role of stress and depressive symptoms in this relationship. Perceived racial discrimination has been associated with poor health outcomes in blacks; its relationship to medication adherence among hypertensive patients remains untested.
AB  - METHODS: We measured perceived racial discrimination at baseline, stress and depressive symptoms at 6 months, and medication adherence at 12 months among patients enrolled in a 30-site cluster-randomized controlled trial testing a patient and physician-targeted intervention to improve blood pressure. A mediational method with bootstrapping (stratified by site) confidence intervals was used to estimate the indirect association between perceived discrimination and medication adherence through stress and depression.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 1056 patients from 30 sites enrolled in the trial, 463 had complete data on all four measures at 6 and 12 months and were included in the analyses. Adjusting for clustering, perceived discrimination was associated with poor medication adherence (B = 0.138, p = .011) at 12 months, and with stress (B = 2.24, p = .001) and depression (B = 1.47, p = .001) at 6 months. When stress and depression were included in the model, there was a 65% reduction in the total association of perceived discrimination with medication adherence, and the relationship was no longer significant (B = 0.049, p = .35).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Perceived discrimination is associated with poor medication adherence among hypertensive blacks, and stress and depressive symptoms may account for this relationship.

TI  - More rigorous protocol adherence to intensive structured management improves blood pressure control in primary care: results from the Valsartan Intensified Primary carE Reduction of Blood Pressure study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine protocol adherence to structured intensive management in the Valsartan Intensified Primary carE Reduction of Blood Pressure (VIPER-BP) study involving 119 primary care clinics and 1562 randomized participants.
AB  - METHODS: Prospective criteria for assessing adherence to treatment prescription, uptitration, and visit attendance at 6, 10, 14, and 18 weeks postrandomization were applied to 1038 intervention participants. Protocol adherence scores of 1-5 (least to most adherent) were compared to blood pressure (BP) control during 26 weeks of follow-up.
AB  - RESULTS: Mean age was 59.3 +/- 12.0 years, 963 (62%) were men, and 1045 (67%) had longstanding hypertension. Clinic attendance dropped from 91 (week 6) to 83% (week 26) and pharmacological instructions were followed for 93% (baseline) to 61% at week 14 (uptitration failures commonly representing protocol deviations). Overall, 26-week BP levels and BP target attainment ranged from 132 +/- 14/79 +/- 9 and 51% to 141 +/- 15/83 +/- 11  mmHg and 19% in those participants subject to the highest (n = 270, 26%) versus least (n = 148, 14%) per protocol adherence, respectively; adjusted relative risk (RR) 1.22 per unit protocol adherence score, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15-1.31; for achieving BP target (P < 0.001). Participants with a per protocol score of 4 or 5 (512/1038, 49.3%) were 1.54-fold (95% CI 1.31-1.81; P < 0.001) more likely to achieve their individual BP target compared with usual care. Clinics equipped with a practice nurse significantly influenced protocol adherence (adjusted RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.06-1.37; P = 0.004) and individual BP control (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.04-1.41; P = 0.015).
AB  - CONCLUSION: There is considerable potential for structured care management to improve BP control in primary care, especially when optimally applied.

TI  - Efficacy of a nurse-led email reminder program for cardiovascular prevention risk reduction in hypertensive patients: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many strategies have been evaluated to improve the prevention and control of cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors. Nursing telephonic and tele-counseling individualized lifestyle educational programs have been found to improve blood pressure control and adherence to lifestyle recommendation. This study tested the efficacy of a nurse-led reminder program through email (NRP-e) to improve CVD risk factors among hypertensive adults.
AB  - METHODS: All participants received usual CVD prevention and a guideline-based educational program. Subjects in the NRP-e group also received weekly email alerts and phone calls from a nurse care manager for 6 months. Emails contained a reminder program on the need for adherence with a healthy lifestyle based upon current guidelines. Follow-up visits were scheduled at 1, 3 and 6 months after enrollment; randomization was made centrally and blood samples were evaluated into a single laboratory.
AB  - RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 98 (control) and 100 (NRP-e) subjects (mean age 59.0 +/- 14.5 years; 51.0% males). After 6 months, the following CVD risk factors significantly improved in both groups: body mass index, alcohol and fruit consumption, cigarette smoking, adherence to therapy hours, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and total cholesterol, triglycerides, and physical activity. In the NRP-e group, however, the prevalence of several behaviors or conditions at risk decreased significantly more than in the control group: obesity (-16%), low fruit consumption (-24%), uncontrolled hypertension (-61%), LDL (-56%), and total cholesterol (-40%).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The NRP-e improved a range of CVD risk factors. The program had low costs, required only an average of <20 min per day in addition to normal practice, and may deserve further evaluation for the inclusion among existing care management approaches.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Adjusted drug treatment is superior to renal sympathetic denervation in patients with true treatment-resistant hypertension.
AB  - We aimed to investigate for the first time the blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect of renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) versus clinically adjusted drug treatment in true treatment-resistant hypertension (TRH) after excluding patients with confounding poor drug adherence. Patients with apparent TRH (n=65) were referred for RDN, and those with secondary and spurious hypertension (n=26) were excluded. TRH was defined as office systolic BP (SBP) >140 mm Hg, despite maximally tolerated doses of >3 antihypertensive drugs including a diuretic. In addition, ambulatory daytime SBP >135 mm Hg after witnessed intake of antihypertensive drugs was required, after which 20 patients had normalized BP and were excluded. Patients with true TRH were randomized and underwent RDN (n=9) performed with Symplicity Catheter System versus clinically adjusted drug treatment (n=10). The study was stopped early for ethical reasons because RDN had uncertain BP-lowering effect. Office SBP and diastolic BP in the drug-adjusted group changed from 160+/-14/88+/-13 mm Hg (+/-SD) at baseline to 132+/-10/77+/-8 mm Hg at 6 months (P<0.0005 and P=0.02, SBP and diastolic BP, respectively) and in the RDN group from 156+/-13/91+/-15 to 148+/-7/89+/-8 mm Hg (P=0.42 and P=0.48, SBP and diastolic BP, respectively). SBP and diastolic BP were significantly lower in the drug-adjusted group at 6 months (P=0.002 and P=0.004, respectively), and absolute changes in SBP were larger in the drug-adjusted group (P=0.008). Ambulatory BPs changed in parallel to office BPs. Our data suggest that adjusted drug treatment has superior BP lowering effects compared with RDN in patients with true TRH.

TI  - Evaluation of the effect of motivational interviewing counselling on hypertension care.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study tests the effectiveness of motivational interviewing compared with the usual care for Chinese hypertensive patients.
AB  - METHODS: A randomised controlled trial was used. One hundred and twenty eligible participants were randomly assigned to either the control group (usual care group) or the intervention group (motivational interviewing group).
AB  - RESULTS: The results of this study demonstrated that the total scores and the mean scores for each dimension of the adherence questionnaire were increased in the intervention group (P<0.05), and the systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure of the hypertensive patients greatly decreased in the intervention group during the six months of the motivational interviewing counselling (P<0.05).
AB  - CONCLUSION: The application of motivational interviewing for hypertensive patients is a promising approach for sustaining the clinical benefits of adherence behaviour.
AB  - PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Motivational interviewing should be provided to hypertensive patients at hospitals and community health centres to assist patients in controlling their BP and to enhance treatment adherence. A series of training courses on the motivational interviewing technique should be provided to nurses.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Improving adherence to glaucoma medication: a randomised controlled trial of a patient-centred intervention (The Norwich Adherence Glaucoma Study).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Improving adherence to ocular hypertension (OH)/glaucoma therapy is highly likely to prevent or reduce progression of optic nerve damage. The present study used a behaviour change counselling intervention to determine whether education and support was beneficial and cost-effective in improving adherence with glaucoma therapy.
AB  - METHODS: A randomised controlled trial with a 13-month recruitment and 8-month follow-up period was conducted. Patients with OH/glaucoma attending a glaucoma clinic and starting treatment with travoprost were approached. Participants were randomised into two groups and adherence was measured over 8 months, using an electronic monitoring device (Travalert dosing aid, TDA). The control group received standard clinical care, and the intervention group received a novel glaucoma education and motivational support package using behaviour change counselling. Cost-effectiveness framework analysis was used to estimate any potential cost benefit of improving adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: Two hundred and eight patients were recruited (102 intervention, 106 control). No significant difference in mean adherence over the monitoring period was identified with 77.2% (CI, 73.0, 81.4) for the control group and 74.8% (CI, 69.7, 79.9) for the intervention group (p = 0.47). Similarly, there was no significant difference in percentage intraocular pressure reduction; 27.6% (CI, 23.5, 31.7) for the control group and 25.3% (CI, 21.06, 29.54) for the intervention group (p = 0.45). Participants in the intervention group were more satisfied with information about glaucoma medication with a mean score of 14.47/17 (CI, 13.85, 15.0) compared with control group which was 8.51 (CI, 7.72, 9.30). The mean intervention cost per patient was GB10.35 (<US$16) and not cost-effective.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Adherence with travoprost was high and not further increased by the intervention. Nevertheless, the study demonstrated that provision of information, tailored to the individual, was inexpensive and able to achieve high patient satisfaction with respect to information about glaucoma medication. Measurement of adherence remains problematic since awareness of study participation may cause a change in participant behaviour.

TI  - The evening versus morning polypill utilization study: the TEMPUS rationale and design.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE: In clinical practice, blood pressure (BP)-lowering agents are generally prescribed for use in the morning, whereas (short-acting) statins are recommended for use in the evening. There is evidence that the reduction in LDL cholesterol (LDL-c) achieved with short-acting statins is superior when taken in the evening and reported improvement in BP control when aspirin and BP-lowering agents are taken in the evening. However, it is unclear whether the additional reduction in LDL-c and BP is offset by a reduction in adherence, given that taking medication in the evening may be less typical or convenient. There is therefore uncertainty concerning the best timing of administration of a cardiovascular combination pill such as the polypill.
AB  - AIM: The aim of TEMPUS (NCT01506505), a prospective randomized open blinded endpoint (PROBE) crossover trial, is to evaluate whether there is a difference in LDL-c levels or 24-hour ambulatory BP in individuals at increased risk of cardiovascular disease when the cardiovascular polypill is taken in the evening compared to the morning. An additional aim is to assess the effect of the polypill on LDL-c and BP compared to the administration of separate pills of identically dosed components of the polypill.
AB  - METHODS: In total 75 participants with established cardiovascular disease or an intermediate to high risk for cardiovascular disease are randomly allocated to the sequence of three different treatments of 6-8 weeks: (1) the cardiovascular polypill (aspirin 75 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) in the evening; (2) the polypill in the morning; and (3) the use of the identically dosed agents in separate pills taken at different time points during the day. The primary endpoint is the difference in LDL-c and mean 24-hour ambulatory systolic BP. Secondary outcomes are the difference in relative risk reduction, biochemistry, platelet function and pulse wave analysis, participants' adherence, and acceptability.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: TEMPUS will evaluate the effect of timing of the administration of a cardiovascular polypill on LDL-c and BP measurements in patients with an intermediate or high risk for cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Do the benefits of participation in a hypertension self-management trial persist after patients resume usual care?.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension self-management has been shown to improve systolic blood pressure (BP) control, but longer-term economic and clinical impacts are unknown. The purpose of this article is to examine clinical and economic outcomes 18 months after completion of a hypertension self-management trial.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: This study is a follow-up analysis of an 18-month, 4-arm, hypertension self-management trial of 591 veterans with hypertension who were randomized to usual care or 1 of 3 interventions. Clinic-derived systolic blood pressure obtained before, during, and after the trial were estimated using linear mixed models. Inpatient admissions, outpatient expenditures, and total expenditures were estimated using generalized estimating equations. The 3 telephone-based interventions were nurse-administered health behavior promotion, provider-administered medication adjustments based on hypertension treatment guidelines, or a combination of both. Intervention calls were triggered by home BP values transmitted via telemonitoring devices. Clinical and economic outcomes were examined 12 months before, 18 months during, and 18 months after trial completion. Compared with usual care, patients randomized to the combined arm had greater improvement in proportion of BP control during and after the 18-month trial and estimated proportion of BP control improved 18 months after trial completion for patients in the behavioral and medication management arms. Among the patients with inadequate baseline BP control, estimated mean systolic BP was significantly lower in the combined arm as compared with usual care during and after the 18-month trial. Utilization and expenditure trends were similar for patients in all 4 arms.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral and medication management can generate systolic BP improvements that are sustained 18 months after trial completion.

TI  - Culturally adapted hypertension education (CAHE) to improve blood pressure control and treatment adherence in patients of African origin with uncontrolled hypertension: cluster-randomized trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of a practice-based, culturally appropriate patient education intervention on blood pressure (BP) and treatment adherence among patients of African origin with uncontrolled hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: Cluster randomised trial involving four Dutch primary care centres and 146 patients (intervention n=75, control n=71), who met the following inclusion criteria: self-identified Surinamese or Ghanaian; > 20 years; treated for hypertension; SBP > 140 mmHg. All patients received usual hypertension care. The intervention-group was also offered three nurse-led, culturally appropriate hypertension education sessions. BP was assessed with Omron 705-IT and treatment adherence with lifestyle- and medication adherence scales.
AB  - RESULTS: 139 patients (95%) completed the study (intervention n=71, control n=68). Baseline characteristics were largely similar for both groups. At six months, we observed a SBP reduction of > 10 mmHg -primary outcome- in 48% of the intervention group and 43% of the control group. When adjusted for pre-specified covariates age, sex, hypertension duration, education, baseline measurement and clustering effect, the between-group difference was not significant (OR; 0.42; 95% CI: 0.11 to 1.54; P=0.19). At six months, the mean SBP/DBD had dropped by 10/5.7 (SD 14.3/9.2)mmHg in the intervention group and by 6.3/1.7 (SD 13.4/8.6)mmHg in the control group. After adjustment, between-group differences in SBP and DBP reduction were -1.69 mmHg (95% CI: -6.01 to 2.62, P=0.44) and -3.01 mmHg (-5.73 to -0.30, P=0.03) in favour of the intervention group. Mean scores for adherence to lifestyle recommendations increased in the intervention group, but decreased in the control group. Mean medication adherence scores improved slightly in both groups. After adjustment, the between-group difference for adherence to lifestyle recommendations was 0.34 (0.12 to 0.55; P=0.003). For medication adherence it was -0.09 (-0.65 to 0.46; P=0.74).
AB  - CONCLUSION: This intervention led to significant improvements in DBP and adherence to lifestyle recommendations, supporting the need for culturally appropriate hypertension care.

TI  - A mixed-method approach to evaluate a pharmacist intervention for veterans with hypertension.
AB  - This paper examines blood pressure (BP) control after 6 months of an intensive pharmacist-managed intervention in a mixed-methods randomized controlled trial conducted at the Iowa City Veteran Affairs Health Care System and two community-based outreach clinics. Patients received the pharmacist intervention for the first 6 months. The study coordinator conducted a summative evaluation with 37 patients 18 to 24 months following the initial 6-month intervention period. BP was significantly reduced in diabetic patients following an intensive pharmacist intervention (-8.0/-4.0 +/- 14.4/9.1 mm Hg systolic/diastolic, P<.001 and P=.001, respectively). BP was reduced even more in nondiabetic patients (-14.0/-5.0 +/- 1.9/10.0 mm Hg, P<.001). Medication adherence significantly improved from baseline to 6 months (P=.017). BPs were significantly lower at 6 months following an intensive pharmacist intervention. Patients also expressed a high level of satisfaction with and preference for co-management of their hypertension, as well as other chronic diseases.Copyright ©2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - In vivo confocal microscopy of conjunctiva in preservative-free timolol 0.1% gel formulation therapy for glaucoma.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects at 1 year of preservative-free timolol gel and preserved timolol eye drops on conjunctiva and tear parameters.
AB  - METHODS: Forty patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomized to the two treatment groups and compared with 20 healthy age-matched controls. Clinical tests (IOP, Schirmer I test, and lacrimal film break-up time BUT) and in vivo conjunctival confocal microscopy (IVCM) were performed in all patients at baseline and after 12 months. IVCM (HRT II Rostock Cornea Module; Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) was performed after topical anaesthesia in the four cardinal locations and at the corresponding limbus to analyse conjunctiva cells. The main IVCM outcomes were goblet cell density and epithelial regularity.
AB  - RESULTS: IVCM and clinical parameters were similar in the three groups at baseline. After 12 months, intra-epithelial goblet cell density was significantly lower in the preserved (48.25 +/- 7.70) than in the preservative-free beta-blocker group (86.83 +/- 22.17, p < 0.001) and controls (88.9 +/- 18.33, p < 0.001). The epithelial layer was significantly more regular in the preserved beta-blocker medication group than in the preservative-free beta-blocker group (p < 0.001) and the control group (p < 0.001). A significant reduction in both Schirmer I and BUT was found in the group of preserved timolol (respectively, 11.3 +/- 2.97 and 8.12 +/- 0.99) compared with preservative-free timolol (16.8 +/- 1.83 and 11.27 +/- 1.27, p < 0.001) and controls (17.8 +/- 1.87 and 12.10 +/- 1.28, p < 0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Based on our IVCM data, preservative-free beta-blocker gel induces less changes at ocular surface than preserved beta-blockers, a fact that should be considered to obtain less adverse effects and maximal adherence to treatment in a chronic condition such as glaucoma.Copyright © 2013 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

TI  - Who is being reached for a telephone-delivered intervention for patients with uncontrolled hypertension?.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Telephone-delivered interventions to provide health counseling for complex chronic medical conditions are convenient, acceptable, and cost-effective. However, little is known about which patients are reached, their characteristics, and who benefits most from telephone-delivered counseling.
AB  - MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study examined whether baseline characteristics are predictive of being easily reached for a monthly, telephone-delivered behavioral intervention to improve treatment adherence in Veterans with uncontrolled hypertension. Participants were to complete a telephone session once a month for 6 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Participants completed an average of 5.71 out of a possible 6 sessions. Participants who were unmarried, African American, unemployed, or younger or did not complete high school required significantly more call attempts per completed session.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Overall, telephone-delivered counseling is a feasible approach to reaching hypertensive patients. Patients who are married, Hispanic, retired, or older or graduated college may be easier to reach and engage in telephone-delivered counseling. Reaching patients with other sociodemographic characteristics may require more resources or alternate methods.

TI  - Self-management in chronic conditions: partners in health scale instrument validation.
AB  - AIMS: This article describes a study that aimed to validate the Self-care in Chronic Conditions Partners in Health Scale instrument in the Mexican population. The instrument has been validated in Australia for use as a screening tool by primary healthcare professionals to assess the self-care skills and abilities of people with a chronic illness.
AB  - METHODS: Validation was conducted using baseline data for 552 people with diabetes, hypertension and cancer aged 18 or older who were users of healthcare centres in Tampico, Tamaulipas, Mexico.
AB  - RESULTS: Results show high reliability and validity of the instrument and three themes were identified: knowledge, adherence, and dealing with and managing side effects.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The findings suggest the scale is useful as a generic self-rated clinical tool for assessing self-management in a range of chronic conditions, and provides an outcome measure for comparing populations and change in patient self-management knowledge and behaviour. The authors recommend validating the scale in other Latin-American settings with more research into the effect of gender on self- management.

TI  - Guideline adherence in antithrombotic treatment after concomitant ablation surgery in atrial fibrillation patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We investigated real-life oral anticoagulation (OAC) treatment after surgical ablation and examined its adherence to current recommendations. We also explored factors related to OAC use preoperatively and at follow-up.
AB  - METHODS: One hundred and fifteen patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) were evaluated during 12-month follow-up after surgery. Patients were divided into two categories according to the congestive heart failure, hypertension, age >75 years, diabetes and prior stroke [or transient ischaemic attack or thromboembolism] (CHADS2) score: 60 patients were assigned to the high-risk group (CHADS2 score >2) and 55 to the low-risk group (CHADS2 score <1). OAC use was defined as guideline adherent, undertreatment or overtreatment.
AB  - RESULTS: Baseline overall guideline adherence was 62%. OAC was underprescribed in high-risk patients and overprescribed in low-risk patients (both, P < 0.001). The only factor associated with OAC use after logistic regression analysis were age >75 years (P = 0.01) and preoperative AF > paroxysmal (P = 0.013). Overall guideline adherence at 12-month follow-up showed a trend towards a better adherence in the sinus rhythm (SR) subgroup (74% vs 55%, P = 0.02). OAC was underprescribed in high-risk patients and overprescribed in low-risk patients (both P < 0.001). After logistic regression analysis, preoperative OAC use (P = 0.007) and other indications for OAC (P = 0.01) were predictors of anticoagulation treatment.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Real-life OAC prescription in AF patients showed a moderate guideline adherence, with high-risk patients being undertreated and low-risk patients being overtreated. These findings stress the importance that antithrombotic treatment in patients undergoing AF surgery needs to be critically re-evaluated.

TI  - Perceived racial discrimination and adoption of health behaviors in hypertensive Black Americans: the CAATCH trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies examine psychosocial factors influencing the adoption of healthy behaviors among hypertensive patients. The effect of discrimination on health behaviors remains untested.
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the influence of discrimination on adoption of healthy behaviors among low-income Black hypertensive patients.
AB  - METHODS: Black patients (N = 930) in community-based primary care practices enrolled in the CAATCH trial. Mixed effects regressions examined associations between perceived discrimination and change in medication adherence, diet, and physical activity from baseline to 12 months, controlling for intervention, gender, age, income, and education.
AB  - RESULTS: Patients were low-income, high-school-educated, with a mean age of 57 years. Greater discrimination was associated with worse diet and lower medication adherence at baseline. Discrimination was associated with greater improvement in healthy eating behaviors over the course of the 12-month trial.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Prior exposure to discrimination was associated with unhealthy behaviors at baseline, but did not negatively influence the adoption of health behaviors over time.

TI  - The Cardiovascular Intervention Improvement Telemedicine Study (CITIES): rationale for a tailored behavioral and educational pharmacist-administered intervention for achieving cardiovascular disease risk reduction.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes are significant, but often preventable, contributors to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Medication and behavioral nonadherence are significant barriers to successful hypertension, hyperlidemia, and diabetes management. Our objective was to describe the theoretical framework underlying a tailored behavioral and educational pharmacist-administered intervention for achieving CVD risk reduction.
AB  - MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adults with poorly controlled hypertension and/or hyperlipidemia were enrolled from three outpatient primary care clinics associated with the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Durham, NC). Participants were randomly assigned to receive a pharmacist-administered, tailored, 1-year telephone-based intervention or usual care. The goal of the study was to reduce the risk for CVD through a theory-driven intervention to increase medication adherence and improve health behaviors.
AB  - RESULTS: Enrollment began in November 2011 and is ongoing. The target sample size is 500 patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The Cardiovascular Intervention Improvement Telemedicine Study (CITIES) intervention has been designed with a strong theoretical underpinning. The theoretical foundation and intervention are designed to encourage patients with multiple comorbidities and poorly controlled CVD risk factors to engage in home-based monitoring and tailored telephone-based interventions. Evidence suggests that clinical pharmacist-administered telephone-based interventions may be efficiently integrated into primary care for patients with poorly controlled CVD risk factors.

TI  - Efficacy of a text messaging (SMS) based intervention for adults with hypertension: protocol for the StAR (SMS Text-message Adherence suppoRt trial) randomised controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interventions to support people with hypertension in attending clinics and taking their medication have potential to improve outcomes, but delivery on a wide scale and at low cost is challenging. Some trials evaluating clinical interventions using short message service (SMS) text-messaging systems have shown important outcomes, although evidence is limited. We have developed a novel SMS system integrated with clinical care for use by people with hypertension in a low-resource setting. We aim to test the efficacy of the system in improving blood pressure control and treatment adherence compared to usual care.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: The SMS Text-message Adherence suppoRt trial (StAR) is a pragmatic individually randomised three-arm parallel group trial in adults treated for hypertension at a single primary care centre in Cape Town, South Africa. The intervention is a structured programme of clinic appointment, medication pick-up reminders, medication adherence support and hypertension-related education delivered remotely using an automated system with either informational or interactive SMS text-messages. Usual care is supplemented by infrequent non-hypertension related SMS text-messages. Participants are 1:1:1 individually randomised, to usual care or to one of the two active interventions using minimisation to dynamically adjust for gender, age, baseline systolic blood pressure, years with hypertension, and previous clinic attendance. The primary outcome is the change in mean systolic blood pressure at 12-month follow-up from baseline measured with research staff blinded to trial allocation. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients with 80% or more of days medication available, proportion of participants achieving a systolic blood pressure less than 140 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg, hospital admissions, health status, retention in clinical care, satisfaction with treatment and care, and patient related quality of life. Anonymised demographic data are collected on non-participants.
AB  - DISCUSSION: The StAR trial uses a novel, low cost system based on widely available mobile phone technology to deliver the SMS-based intervention, manage communication with patients, and measure clinically relevant outcomes. The results will inform implementation and wider use of mobile phone based interventions for health care delivery in a low-resource setting.

TI  - Design of the Blood Pressure Goals in Dialysis pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is markedly increased among hemodialysis (HD) patients. Optimizing blood pressure (BP) among HD patients may present an important opportunity to reduce the disparity in CVD rates between HD patients and the general population. The optimal target predialysis systolic BP (SBP) among HD patients is unknown. Current international guidelines, calling for a predialysis SBP < 140 mm Hg, are based on the opinion and extrapolation from the general population. Existing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were small and did not include prespecified BP targets.
AB  - METHODS: The authors described the design of the Blood Pressure in Dialysis (BID) Study, a pilot, multicenter RCT where HD patients are randomized to either a target-standardized predialysis SBP of 110 to 140 mm Hg or 155 to 165 mm Hg. This is the first study to randomize HD patients to 2 different SBP targets.
AB  - RESULTS: Primary outcomes are feasibility and safety. Feasibility parameters include recruitment and retention rates, adherence with prescribed BP measurements and achievement and maintenance of selected BP targets. Safety parameters include rates of hypotension and other adverse and serious adverse events. The authors obtained preliminary data on changes in left ventricular mass, aortic pulse wave velocity, vascular access thromboses and health-related quality of life across study arms, which may be the secondary outcomes in the full-scale study.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The data acquired in the pilot RCT will determine the feasibility and safety and inform the design of a full-scale trial, powered for hard outcomes, which may require 2000 participants.

TI  - Implementation of the NHLBI integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: rationale and study design for young hearts, strong starts, a cluster-randomized trial targeting body mass index, blood pressure, and tobacco.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the underlying atherosclerosis begin in childhood, and their presence and intensity are related to known cardiovascular disease risk factors. Attention to risk factor control in childhood has the potential to reduce subsequent risk of CVD.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Young Hearts Strong Starts Study was designed to test strategies facilitating adoption of the National, Heart, Lung and Blood Institute supported Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction in Children and Adolescents. This study compares guideline-based quality measures for body mass index, blood pressure, and tobacco using two strategies: a multifaceted, practice-directed intervention versus standard dissemination.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Two primary care research networks recruited practices and provided support for the intervention and outcome evaluations. Individual practices were randomly assigned to the intervention or control groups using a cluster randomized design based on network affiliation, number of clinicians per practice, urban versus nonurban location, and practice type. The units of observation are individual children because measure adherence is abstracted from individual patient's medical records. The units of randomization are physician practices. This results in a multilevel design in which patients are nested within practices. The intervention practices received toolkits and supported guideline implementation including academic detailing, an ongoing e-learning group. This project is aligned with the American Board of Pediatrics Maintenance of Certification requirements including monthly physician self-abstraction, webinars, and other elements of the trial.
AB  - SIGNIFICANCE: This trial will provide an opportunity to demonstrate tools and strategies to enhance CV prevention in children by guideline-based interventions.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - TRIple pill vs Usual care Management for Patients with mild-to-moderate Hypertension (TRIUMPH): Study protocol.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension management strategies have traditionally focused on "tailored therapy" and "stepped-care" approaches. These tend to be costly and time consuming and often fail to achieve adequate blood pressure (BP) control. The TRIUMPH study aims to investigate the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and acceptability of early use of a 3-in-1 BP-lowering pill ("Triple Pill") compared with usual care for the management of hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: The prospective, open, randomized controlled clinical trial (n = 700) will compare Triple Pill-based strategy to usual care among individuals with persistent mild-to-moderate hypertension (systolic BP >140 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP >90 mm Hg, or systolic BP >130 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP >80 mm Hg in patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease) on no or minimal drug therapy. The study will be conducted within approximately 20 hospital-based clinics in India. Participants will be randomized to the Triple Pill (initially strength 1-telmisartan 20 mg, amlodipine 2.5 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg, with the option of subsequent titration to strength 2-telmisartan 40 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) or continued usual care. Participants will be followed up for 6 months. The primary outcome is the proportion of participants achieving target BP at the end follow-up.
AB  - CONCLUSION: This study will determine whether early use of a low-dose triple combination therapy has the potential to address some of the challenges in hypertension control through earlier achievement of BP control, better adherence, and fewer adverse effects, in the context of less intensive clinical follow-up.Copyright © 2014.

TI  - Stress management and dietary counseling in hypertensive patients: a pilot study of additional effect.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Western societies, cardiovascular (CV) disease is the primary cause of mortality, and high blood pressure (BP) is the main reversible factor leading to CV disease. Dietary habits and psychosocial stress contribute to the establishment of hypertension, while its role in the control of high BP is currently examined. In this study, we examined the effect and feasibility of a combined intervention of dietary education and stress management on the control of hypertension.
AB  - METHODOLOGY: A randomized, controlled pilot study was designed to evaluate the effect of combined education on stress management techniques and dietary habits (Mediterranean diet principle) on office BP after eight weeks.
AB  - RESULTS: Of the 45 randomized subjects, 36 were included in the final analysis (control group = 20 (age: 67 +/- 12 years, 31.8%, males) and intervention group = 16 (age: 62 +/- 12 years, 47%, males)). CV disease risk factors (except smoking), BP, dietary habits, perceived stress and physical activity (all assessed with validated questionnaires) were similar between the two groups at baseline. After eight weeks, office BP (systolic and diastolic) and perceived stress were significantly reduced, whereas the adherence in Mediterranean diet principle was significantly increased, but only in the intervention group.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A combined intervention of stress management techniques and Mediterranean diet education seems to be beneficial for BP reduction. Such interventions could possibly serve as a complementary treatment along with drug therapy or in the early treatment of high normal BP. A call to action for designing epidemiological studies and evaluating the efficacy of such non-pharmacological treatment strategies is therefore warranted.

TI  - Resistant hypertension optimal treatment trial: a randomized controlled trial.[Erratum appears in Clin Cardiol. 2014 Jun;37(6):388 Note: Multiple investigator names added]
AB  - The prevalence of resistant hypertension (ReHy) is not well established. Furthermore, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers are largely used as the first 3-drug combinations for treating ReHy. However, the fourth drug to be added to the triple regimen is still controversial and guided by empirical choices. We sought (1) to determine the prevalence of ReHy in patients with stage II hypertension; (2) to compare the effects of spironolactone vs clonidine, when added to the triple regimen; and (3) to evaluate the role of measuring sympathetic and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone activities in predicting blood pressure response to spironolactone or clonidine. The Resistant Hypertension Optimal Treatment (ReHOT) study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01643434) is a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial comprising 26 sites in Brazil. In step 1, 2000 patients will be treated according to hypertension guidelines for 12 weeks, to detect the prevalence of ReHy. Medical therapy adherence will be checked by pill count monitoring. In step 2, patients with confirmed ReHy will be randomized to an open label 3-month treatment with spironolactone (titrating dose, 12.5-50 mg once daily) or clonidine (titrating dose, 0.1-0.3 mg twice daily). The primary endpoint is the effective control of blood pressure after a 12-week randomized period of treatment. The ReHOT study will disseminate results about the prevalence of ReHy in stage II hypertension and the comparison of spironolactone vs clonidine for blood pressure control in patients with ReHy under 3-drug standard regimen.

TI  - Visit-to-visit blood pressure variability and cardiovascular death in the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program.
AB  - Most studies of an association of visit-to-visit variability of blood pressure with increased risk of future adverse cardiovascular events are of short duration and rarely include a placebo group. Using data from the double-blind, placebo-controlled Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program, the authors examined mortality from cardiovascular causes up to 17 years of follow-up using the National Death Index. Visit-to-visit blood pressure variability was associated with cardiovascular death after adjustment for sex, age, serum creatinine, diabetes, body mass index, smoking status, left ventricular failure, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The relationship was significantly stronger in the active treatment group compared with the placebo group. Although this could be the result of an effect of the medications used unrelated to visit-to-visit variability, the data are compatible with the hypothesis that inconsistent adherence leading to missing active medication doses may be an additional explanation for the relationship of visit-to-visit variability with cardiovascular death.

TI  - Challenges in measuring medication adherence: experiences from a controlled trial.
AB  - Measurement of adherence is complex and many methods, both direct and indirect are used; there is no universal gold standard. In this article, we share our experiences in a randomised controlled study, the Hypertension Adherence Program in Pharmacy trial, evaluating a community pharmacy-based intervention for improving adherence to antihypertensive medication. Several objective and subjective measures of adherence (Morisky score, TABS score, MedsIndex, Medicines Possession Ratio) were used, but produced varying results, limiting confidence in the conclusions that could be drawn. Despite using a specifically designed data mining software program to identify potentially nonadherent patients from dispensing records, many participants were found to be adherent by the self reported Morisky scale. A lesson to be learned when targeting people for interventions to improve adherence is that information from dispensing records should be supplemented by other methods in order to identify patients most in need of assistance.

TI  - A double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial of varenicline for smokeless tobacco dependence in India.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The rate of smokeless tobacco use in India is 20%; its use causes serious health problems, and no trial has assessed behavioral or pharmacological treatments for this public health concern. This trial evaluated varenicline for treating smokeless tobacco dependence in India.
AB  - METHODS: This was a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial of varenicline (12 weeks, 1mg, twice per day) with 237 smokeless tobacco users in India. All participants received behavioral counseling. Outcomes included self-reported and biochemically verified abstinence at the end of treatment (EOT), lapse and recovery events, safety, and medication adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: Self-reported EOT abstinence was significantly greater for varenicline (43%) versus placebo (31%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.2-4.2, p = .009). Biochemically confirmed EOT abstinence was greater for varenicline versus placebo (25.2% vs. 19.5%), but this was not statistically different (AOR = 1.6, 95% CI = 0.84-3.1, p = .15). Compared with placebo, varenicline did not reduce the risk for a lapse (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.69-1.1, p = .14), but it did increase the likelihood of recovery to abstinence (HR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.02-1.4, p = .02). Greater adherence increased EOT cessation rates for varenicline (39% vs. 18%, p = .003) but not for placebo (28% vs. 14%, p = .06). There were no significant differences between varenicline and placebo in rate of side effects, serious adverse events, hypertension, or stopping or reducing medication.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Varenicline is safe for treating smokeless tobacco dependence in India, and further examination of this medication for this important public health problem is warranted.

TI  - Hypertension analysis of stress reduction using mindfulness meditation and yoga: results from the HARMONY randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The HARMONY study was a randomized, controlled trial examining the efficacy of an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program for blood pressure (BP) lowering among unmedicated stage 1 hypertensive participants.
AB  - METHODS: Participants diagnosed with stage 1 hypertension based on ambulatory BP were randomized to either immediate treatment of MBSR for 8 weeks or wait-list control. Primary outcome analysis evaluated whether change in awake and 24-hour ambulatory BP from baseline to week 12 was significantly different between the 2 groups. A within-group before and after MBSR analysis was also performed.
AB  - RESULTS: The study enrolled 101 adults (38% male) with baseline average 24-hour ambulatory BP of 135+/-7.9/82+/-5.8mm Hg and daytime ambulatory BP of 140+/-7.7/87+/-6.3 mmHg. At week 12, the change from baseline in 24-hour ambulatory BP was 0.4+/-6.7/0.0+/-4.9mm Hg for the immediate intervention and 0.4+/-7.8/-0.4+/-4.6mm Hg for the wait-list control. There were no significant differences between intervention and wait-list control for all ambulatory BP parameters. The secondary within-group analysis found a small reduction in BP after MBSR compared with baseline, a finding limited to female subjects in a sex analysis.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: MBSR did not lower ambulatory BP by a statistically or clinically significant amount in untreated, stage 1 hypertensive patients when compared with a wait-list control group. It leaves untested whether MBSR might be useful for lowering BP by improving adherence in treated hypertensive participants.

TI  - Association of race consciousness with the patient-physician relationship, medication adherence, and blood pressure in urban primary care patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Race consciousness (the frequency with which one thinks about his or her own race) is a measure that may be useful in assessing whether racial discrimination negatively impacts blood pressure (BP). However, the relation between race consciousness and BP has yet to be empirically tested, especially within the context of the patient-physician relationship and medication adherence.
AB  - METHODS: Race-stratified generalized estimating equations were used to assess the relationship of race consciousness on BP, measures of the patient-physician relationship, and self-reported medication adherence, controlling for patients being nested within physicians and for patient age and sex.
AB  - RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 61.3 years, 62% were black, and 65% were women. Black patients were more likely to ever think about race than were white patients (49% vs. 21%; P < 0.001). Race-conscious blacks had significantly higher diastolic BP (79.4 vs. 74.5 mm Hg; P = 0.004) and somewhat higher systolic BP (138.8 vs. 134.7 mm Hg; P = 0.13) than blacks who were not race conscious. Race-conscious whites were more likely to perceive respect from their physician (57.1% vs. 25.8%; P = 0.01) but had lower medication adherence (62.4% vs. 82.9%; P = 0.05) than whites who were not race-conscious.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Among blacks, race consciousness was associated with higher diastolic BP. In contrast, among whites, there was no association between race consciousness and BP, but race consciousness was associated with poor ratings of adherence, despite more favorable ratings of the patient-physician relationship. Future work should explore disparities in race consciousness and its impact on health and health-care disparities.Copyright © American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd 2013. All rights reserved.

TI  - The CLUES study: a cluster randomized clinical trial for the evaluation of cardiovascular guideline implementation in primary care.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The appropriate care for people with cardiovascular risk factors can reduce morbidity and mortality. One strategy for improving the care for these patients involves the implementation of evidence-based guidelines. To date, little research concerning the impact of such implementation strategies in our setting has been published. Aims. To evaluate the effectiveness of a multifaceted tailored intervention in the implementation of three cardiovascular risk-related guidelines (hypertension, type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia) in primary care in the Basque Health Service compared with usual implementation.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: A two-year cluster randomized clinical trial in primary care in two districts in the Basque Health Service. All primary care units are randomized. Data from all patients with diabetes, hypertension and those susceptible to coronary risk screening will be analyzed.Interventions. The control group will receive standard implementation. The experimental group will receive a multifaceted tailored implementation strategy, including a specific web page and workshops for family physicians and nurses.Endpoints. Primary endpoints: annual request for glycosylated hemoglobin, basic laboratory tests for hypertension, cardiovascular risk screening (women between 45-74 and men between 40-74 years old). Secondary endpoints: other process and clinical guideline indicators.
AB  - ANALYSIS: Data will be extracted from centralized computerized medical records. ANALYSIS will be performed at a primary care unit level weighted by cluster size.
AB  - DISCUSSION: The main contribution of our study is that it seeks to identify an effective strategy for cardiovascular guideline implementation in primary care in our setting.

TI  - Cardiovascular disease risk reduction in rural China: a clustered randomized controlled trial in Zhejiang.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of death in China. Despite government efforts, the majority of hypertensive and diabetic patients in China do not receive proper treatment. Reducing CVD events requires long-term care that is proactive, patient-centred, community-based, and sustainable. We have designed a package of interventions for patients at high risk of CVD to be implemented by family doctors based in township hospitals (providers of primary care) in rural Zhejiang, China. This trial aims to determine whether the systematic CVD risk reduction package results in reduced CVD events among patients at risk of CVD compared with usual care, and whether the package is cost-effective and suitable for routine implementation and scale-up.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: This is a prospective, open-label, cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) with blinded data analysis. The trial will randomize 67 township hospitals with 31,708 participants in three counties in Zhejiang Province. Participants will be identified from existing health records and will comprise adults aged 50 to 74 years, with a calculated 10-year CVD risk of 20% or higher, or diabetes. In the intervention arm, participants will receive a package of interventions including: 1) healthy lifestyle counseling (smoking cessation, and salt, oil, and alcohol reduction); 2) prescription of a combination of drugs (antihypertensives, aspirin, and statin); and 3) adherence support for drug compliance and healthy lifestyle change. In the control arm, participants will receive usual care for hypertension and diabetes management at individual clinicians' discretion. The primary outcome is the incidence of severe CVD events over 24 months of follow-up. All CVD events will be defined according to the World Health Organization (WHO) monitoring of trends and determinants in cardiovascular disease (MONICA) definitions, diagnosed at the county hospital or higher level, and reported by the Zhejiang surveillance system. Secondary outcomes include: mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, blood glucose, serum total cholesterol (TC), and adherence to appointments, and drugs and lifestyle changes.
AB  - DISCUSSION: This trial focuses on risk reduction of CVD rather than specific diseases. It is not designed to compare therapeutic and healthy lifestyle interventions, but rather their combined effects in primary care settings. Through the trial, we intend to understand the effectiveness of the comprehensive CVD reduction package in routine practice. We also intend to understand the barriers and facilitators to implementing the package, and thus to advise on policy and practice change.

TI  - Protocol for the New Medicine Service Study: a randomized controlled trial and economic evaluation with qualitative appraisal comparing the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the New Medicine Service in community pharmacies in England.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication non-adherence is considered an important cause of morbidity and mortality in primary care. This study aims to determine the effectiveness, cost effectiveness and acceptability of a complex intervention delivered by community pharmacists, the New Medicine Service (NMS), compared with current practice in reducing non-adherence to, and problems with, newly prescribed medicines for chronic conditions.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: Research subject group: patients aged 14 years and above presenting in a community pharmacy for a newly prescribed medicine for asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); hypertension; type 2 diabetes or anticoagulant/antiplatelet agents in two geographical regions in England.
AB  - DESIGN: parallel group patient-level pragmatic randomized controlled trial.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: patients randomized to either: (i) current practice; or (ii) NMS intervention comprising pharmacist-delivered support for a newly prescribed medicine.
AB  - PRIMARY OUTCOMES: proportion of adherent patients at six, ten and 26 weeks from the date of presenting their prescriptions at the pharmacy; cost effectiveness of the intervention versus current practice at 10 weeks and 26 weeks; in-depth qualitative understanding of the operationalization of NMS in pharmacies.
AB  - SECONDARY OUTCOMES: impact of NMS on: patients' understanding of their medicines, pharmacovigilance, interprofessional and patient-professional relationships and experiences of service users and stakeholders.Economic analysis: Trial-based economic analysis (cost per extra adherent patient) and long-term modeling of costs and health effects (cost per quality-adjusted-life-year) will be conducted from the perspective of National Health Service (NHS) England, comparing NMS with current practice.Qualitative analysis: a qualitative study of NMS implementation in different community settings, how organizational influences affect NMS delivery, patterns of NMS consultations and experiences of professionals and patients participating in NMS, and patients receiving current practice.
AB  - SAMPLE SIZE: 250 patients in each treatment arm would provide at least 80% power (two-tailed alpha of 0.05) to demonstrate a reduction in patient-reported non-adherence from 20% to 10% in the NMS arm compared with current practice, assuming a 20% drop-out rate.
AB  - DISCUSSION: At the time of submission of this article, 58 community pharmacies have been recruited and the interventions are being delivered. Analysis has not yet been undertaken.

TI  - Characteristics, drug combinations and dosages of primary care patients with uncontrolled ambulatory blood pressure and high medication adherence.
AB  - Most studies on the prevalence and determinants of resistant hypertension (RH) do not account for white coat hypertension, medication non-adherence, or use of suboptimal treatment dosages. We studied the characteristics, drug combinations, and dosages of patients on at least three antihypertensives of different classes who had uncontrolled blood pressure on 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and high medication adherence measured by electronic monitoring. The data were collected as part of the baseline measures of a hypertension control trial. Of 140 monitored primary care patients, all with uncontrolled office blood pressure, 69 (49%) were on at least three antihypertensives of different classes. Of these 69, 15 (22%) were controlled on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, 20 (29%) were uncontrolled and non-adherent, leaving only 34 (49%) adherent to their medications and having uncontrolled ambulatory hypertension (uncontrolled RH). Thirty-one (91%) of the 34 uncontrolled RH patients were prescribed a diuretic, of which 24 were on hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. Less than half of the patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, or calcium channel blocker were prescribed maximal doses of these agents. Half of the RH can be attributed to white coat effect and poor medication adherence, and all of the remaining patients were on apparently suboptimal drug combinations and/or dosages. Primary care physicians need to be educated regarding the optimal treatment of RH. Copyright © 2013 American Society of Hypertension. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of a multifaceted intervention on cardiovascular risk factors in high-risk hypertensive patients: the ESCAPE trial, a pragmatic cluster randomized trial in general practice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several observational studies on hypertensive patients have shown a gap between therapeutic targets recommended in guidelines and those achieved in daily practice. The ESCAPE trial aimed to determine whether a multifaceted intervention focused on general practitioners (GPs), could increase significantly the proportion of hypertensive patients at high risk in primary prevention who achieved all their recommended therapeutic targets.
AB  - METHODS: A pragmatic, cluster randomized trial involving 257 GPs randomized by region. The GPs in the intervention group had a one-day training session and were given an electronic blood pressure measurement device and a short recommendation leaflet. Along with usual follow-up, they focused one consultation on hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors every six months for two years. They also received feedback at baseline and at one year on their patients' clinical and biological parameters. Main outcome measures were change in the proportion of patients achieving all their therapeutic targets and each individual therapeutic target at two years, and quality of life.
AB  - RESULTS: 1,832 high-risk hypertensive patients were included. After two years, the proportion of patients achieving all their therapeutic targets increased significantly in both groups, but significantly more in the intervention group: OR (odds-ratio) 1.89, (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09 to 3.27, P = 0.02). Significantly more patients achieved their blood pressure targets in the intervention group than in the usual care group: OR 2.03 (95% CI 1.44 to 2.88, P < 0.0001). Systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased significantly more in the intervention group than in the usual care group, by 4.8 mmHg and 1.9 mmHg, respectively (P < 0.0001 for both). There were no significant difference changes in physical and mental quality of life between groups.
AB  - CONCLUSION: An easy-to-perform, multifaceted intervention targeting only GPs increased significantly the proportion of high-risk hypertensive patients in primary prevention achieving their recommended therapeutic targets.

TI  - Morning dosing of once-daily glaucoma medication is more convenient and may lead to greater adherence than evening dosing.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine if adherence and convenience of once-daily glaucoma medication is greater in the morning or the evening.
AB  - DESIGN: Prospective, randomized crossover treatment trial.
AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients newly diagnosed with glaucoma or ocular hypertension requiring intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction were started on travoprost eye drops and randomized to either morning or evening administration for 1 month. They were then crossed over to the opposite dosing schedule for the following month. Adherence was monitored using an automated dosing aid.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adherence was compared between morning versus evening dosing and first versus second month dosing. Demographic characteristics were obtained, treatment effect was measured, and patients completed a post-study questionnaire regarding the convenience of the 2 dosing regimens.
AB  - RESULTS: Patient adherence overall was good (89.3%). There was no statistically significant difference (P=0.07) in adherence between morning dosing (90.9%) and evening dosing (87.3%). Adherence in the first month (91.7%) was superior to the second month (86.5%). There was no significant difference in IOP response between morning and evening dosing. Patients found morning dosing more convenient than evening dosing.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Early adherence to treatment with a prostaglandin analogue is good, but patients prefer morning administration to evening administration. This may lead to greater adherence with morning administration, particularly among men. Adherence decreases from the first to second month after initiation of treatment. IOP response to this treatment is not significantly affected by morning versus evening administration.

TI  - Shared decision-making in antihypertensive therapy: a cluster randomised controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is one of the key factors causing cardiovascular diseases. A substantial proportion of treated hypertensive patients do not reach recommended target blood pressure values. Shared decision making (SDM) is to enhance the active role of patients. As until now there exists little information on the effects of SDM training in antihypertensive therapy, we tested the effect of an SDM training programme for general practitioners (GPs). Our hypotheses are that this SDM training (1) enhances the participation of patients and (2) leads to an enhanced decrease in blood pressure (BP) values, compared to patients receiving usual care without prior SDM training for GPs.
AB  - METHODS: The study was conducted as a cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) with GP practices in Southwest Germany. Each GP practice included patients with treated but uncontrolled hypertension and/or with relevant comorbidity. After baseline assessment (T0) GP practices were randomly allocated into an intervention and a control arm. GPs of the intervention group took part in the SDM training. GPs of the control group treated their patients as usual. The intervention was blinded to the patients. Primary endpoints on patient level were (1) change of patients' perceived participation (SDM-Q-9) and (2) change of systolic BP (24h-mean). Secondary endpoints were changes of (1) diastolic BP (24h-mean), (2) patients' knowledge about hypertension, (3) adherence (MARS-D), and (4) cardiovascular risk score (CVR).
AB  - RESULTS: In total 1357 patients from 36 general practices were screened for blood pressure control by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Thereof 1120 patients remained in the study because of uncontrolled (but treated) hypertension and/or a relevant comorbidity. At T0 the intervention group involved 17 GP practices with 552 patients and the control group 19 GP practices with 568 patients. The effectiveness analysis could not demonstrate a significant or relevant effect of the SDM training on any of the endpoints.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The study hypothesis that the SDM training enhanced patients' perceived participation and lowered their BP could not be confirmed. Further research is needed to examine the impact of patient participation on the treatment of hypertension in primary care.

TI  - Delivering enhanced cardiovascular (hypertension) disease care through private health facilities in Pakistan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are one of the leading causes of death and disability in the world. Over 80% of CVD deaths take place in low-and middle-income countries. One-third of the population aged above 40 years suffers from Hypertension (HTN) and this is largely unreported as there is no registry for CVDs. No guidelines are available for use in health care facilities, especially private health facilities where practice among GPs varies considerably. We aim to conduct a Cluster Randomized Controlled trial delivering a quality HTN-CVD care package at strengthened private health facilities as compared to current practice at private health facilities.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: A pragmatic cluster randomized trial, with qualitative and economic studies, will be conducted in Sargodha district of Punjab, Pakistan, from January 2012 to December 2016. At least 912 hypertensives will be registered in the two arms, six clusters per arm. The proposed cluster randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of delivering quality HTN-CVD care, through enabled private health care facilities, to achieve better case registration, adherence and hypertension control also blood glucose and serum cholesterol control. The trial will be conducted through the doctors and paramedics at private health facilities. Main outcomes are mean difference in Systolic blood pressure among the two arms. Secondary outcomes are mean change in total serum cholesterol levels and mean change in glycaemic control achieved in the adult hypertensive patients. Individual and Cluster level analysis will be done according to intention-to-treat.
AB  - DISCUSSION: Due to the high burden of disease where 1 in 3 individuals aged above 45 suffers from hypertension, topped with the fact that there is a dearth of a set of available, standardised guidelines for management, the disease is constantly on a hike in Pakistan. The government has made no effort to issue a set of guidelines adapted specifically for our population and this becomes more of a problem when managing CVD in urban population through private practitioners whose practices vary widely.If our set of context sensitive guidelines show an effectiveness in the proposed intervention districts it will be replicated in other such settings.

TI  - EHR-based medication support and nurse-led medication therapy management: rationale and design for a three-arm clinic randomized trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic conditions often use complex medical regimens. A nurse-led strategy to support medication therapy management incorporated into primary care teams may lead to improved use of medications for disease control. Electronic health record (EHR) tools may offer a lower-cost, less intensive approach to improving medication management.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: The Northwestern and Access Community Health Network Medication Education Study is a health center-level cluster-randomized trial being conducted within a network of federally qualified community health centers. Health centers have been enrolled in groups of 3 and randomized to (1) usual care, (2) EHR-based medication management tools alone, or (3) EHR tools plus nurse-led medication therapy management. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension who are prescribed > 3 medications of any kind are recruited from the centers. EHR tools include a printed medication list to prompt review at each visit and automated plain-language medication information within the after-visit summary to encourage proper medication use. In the nurse-led intervention, patients receive one-on-one counseling about their medication regimens to clarify medication discrepancies and identify drug-related concerns, safety issues, and nonadherence. Nurses also provide follow-up telephone calls following new prescriptions and periodically to perform medication review. The primary study outcome is systolic blood pressure after 1 year. Secondary outcomes include measures of understanding of dosing instructions, discrepancies between patient-reported medications and the medical record, adherence, and intervention costs.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The Northwestern and Access Community Health Network Medication Education Study will assess the effects of 2 approaches to support outpatient medication management among patients with uncontrolled hypertension in federally qualified health center settings.

TI  - Evaluation of eye drop administration technique in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate eye drop administration by patients at multiple visits in the setting of a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomized to 12 weeks of treatment with topical ocular hypotensive medication in a multicenter, investigator-masked trial. At baseline, patients were given a questionnaire for self-assessment of difficulty with drop administration. At baseline and 12 weeks, patients demonstrated drop instillation using a bottle of artificial tears.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient self-assessment of difficulty with drop administration and observed patient difficulty with drop administration, defined as bottle touching eye/adnexa, drop missing the ocular surface, or administering more than 1 drop.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 164 enrolled patients, 50% had previously been treated with ocular hypotensive medication for >3 years. Only 11.4% of patients reported difficulty with eye drop administration at study entry. At baseline, 18.2% of patients touched their eye/adnexa with the bottle and 10.3% missed the eye. At 12 weeks, 18.5% and 8.6% of patients, respectively, had similar difficulties. Overall, difficulty with drop instillation was observed in 42.1% of patients. Difficulty at both visits was seen in 35.3% of patients who reported difficulty at entry and in 17.2% of patients who denied difficulty. The relative risk of demonstrating difficulty at either visit was 2.0 times greater for patients who self-reported difficulty at study entry (P = 0.004). The relative risk of demonstrating difficulty at week 12 was 3.8 times greater for patients with observed difficulty at baseline (P < 0.001). Limitations of the study design included self-administration of drops to the eye of the patient's choice and observation in an office setting.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Patients with experience instilling topical glaucoma medications continue to have difficulties with eye drop administration, including patients who do not self-report difficulty. The risk of difficulty with eye drop administration is increased in patients who self-report difficulty and in patients who have been previously observed to have difficulty.

TI  - Adherence improvement in Dutch glaucoma patients: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the effect of patient education and the TravAlert() -Eyot() drop guider on intraocular pressure (IOP) and adherence in patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT) monitored with the TravAlert() dosing aid.
AB  - METHODS: Multicentre, randomized, controlled clinical trial among 18 Dutch hospitals. Patients were randomized to one of the four study arms: (1) use of the dosing aid, (2) use of the dosing aid with the drop guider, (3) use of the dosing aid together with patient education or (4) use of the dosing aid and drop guider together with patient education. IOP was recorded at baseline and after 3 and 6 months. Data on adherence generated by the dosing aid were collected and studied at the end of the study.
AB  - RESULTS: Mean IOP dropped from 20.3 +/- 5.7 mmHg at baseline to 16.3 +/- 4.0 mmHg (right eye) after 6 months and from 20.2 +/- 5.9 mmHg to 16.4 +/- 4.1 mmHg (left eye). The mean adherence rate was 0.91 +/- 0.1. IOP and adherence rate were not statistically different between the study arms. Patients with 'drug holidays' had a significantly higher mean IOP after 6 months. Patients who used the drop guider were less adherent. A lower adherence level was also associated with new patients with glaucoma and patients with a lower level of knowledge on glaucoma.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Patient education is especially useful for new patients with glaucoma. The use of a drop guider does not improve adherence. Especially patients with 'drug holidays' are at risk for developing uncontrolled IOP levels.Copyright © 2012 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

TI  - The impact of health literacy on desire for participation in healthcare, medical visit communication, and patient reported outcomes among patients with hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low health literacy (HL) is associated with poor healthcare outcomes; mechanisms for these associations remain unclear.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To elucidate how HL influences patients' interest in participating in healthcare, medical visit communication, and patient reported visit outcomes.
AB  - DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Cross-sectional study of enrollment data from a randomized controlled trial of interventions to improve patient adherence to hypertension treatments. Participants were 41 primary care physicians and 275 of their patients. Prior to the enrollment visit, physicians received a minimal intervention or communication skills training and patients received a minimal intervention or a pre-visit coaching session. This resulted in four intervention groups (minimal patient/minimal physician; minimal patient/intensive physician; intensive patient/minimal physician; and intensive patient/intensive physician).
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine; patients' desire for involvement in decision making; communication behaviors; patient ratings of participatory decision making (PDM), trust, and satisfaction.
AB  - RESULTS: A lower percentage of patients with low versus adequate literacy had controlled blood pressure. Both groups were similarly interested in participating in medical decision making. Communication behaviors did not differ based on HL except for medical question asking by patients, which was lower among low literacy patients. This was particularly true in the intensive patient /intensive physician group (3.85 vs. 6.42 questions; p = 0.002). Overall, ratings of care didn't differ based on HL; however, in analyses stratified by intervention assignment, patients with low literacy in minimal physician intervention groups reported significantly lower PDM scores than adequate literacy patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Patients with low and adequate literacy were similarly interested in participating in medical decision making. However, low literacy patients were less likely to experience PDM in their visits. Low literacy patients in the intensive physician intervention groups asked fewer medical questions. Patients with low literacy may be less able to respond to physicians' use of patient-centered communication approaches than adequate literacy patients.

TI  - Impact of antihypertensive medication adherence on blood pressure control in hypertension: the COMFORT study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has not been fully elucidated whether antihypertensive medication adherence affects blood pressure (BP) control in hypertension cases.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the association of adherence to antihypertensive drug regimens and BP control using data from the Combination Pill of Losartan Potassium and Hydrochlorothiazide for Improvement of Medication Compliance Trial (COMFORT) study.
AB  - DESIGN: An observational analysis from a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - METHODS: A total of 203 hypertensive subjects were randomly assigned to a daily regimen of a combination pill (losartan 50 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) or two pills, an angiotensin II receptor blocker and a thiazide diuretic. Medication adherence calculated based on pill counts and BPs was evaluated at 1, 3 and 6 months after randomization.
AB  - RESULTS: The subjects were divided into three groups according to their adherence, i.e. relatively low-adherence (<90%; n = 19), moderate-adherence (90-99%; n = 71) and high-adherence (100%; n = 113) groups. Clinical characteristics of the subjects including BP, sex, randomized treatments and past medical history did not differ significantly among the three groups. Achieved follow-up BPs over the 6-month treatment period, which were adjusted for age, sex, baseline BP and randomized treatment, were significantly higher in the low-adherence group (135/78 mmHg) compared with the high-adherence (130/74 mmHg; P = 0.02/0.02) and the moderate-adherence (128/74 mmHg; P = 0.003/0.02) groups.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Low adherence to an antihypertensive-drug regimen was associated with poor BP control.

TI  - Improving refill adherence and hypertension control in black patients: Wisconsin TEAM trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness and sustainability of a 6-month Team Education and Adherence Monitoring (TEAM) intervention for black patients with hypertension in community chain pharmacies.
AB  - DESIGN: Cluster randomized trial.
AB  - SETTING: 28 chain pharmacies (14 TEAM and 14 control) in five Wisconsin cities from December 2006 to February 2009.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: 576 black patients with hypertension.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Trained pharmacist-technician teams implemented a 6-month intervention using scheduled visits, Brief Medication Questionnaires (BMQs), and novel toolkits for facilitating medication adherence and pharmacist feedback to patients and physicians. Control participants received patient information only.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Refill adherence (>80% days covered) and changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure, and blood pressure control using blinded assessments at 6 and 12 months.
AB  - RESULTS: At baseline, all patients had blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or more. Of those eligible, 79% activated the intervention (mean 4.25 visits). Compared with control participants at 6 months, TEAM participants achieved greater improvements in refill adherence (60% vs. 34%, P < 0.001), SBP (-12.62 vs. -5.31 mm Hg, P < 0.001), and blood pressure control (50% vs. 36%, P = 0.01). Six months after intervention discontinuation, TEAM participants showed sustained improvements in refill adherence ( P < 0.001) and SBP ( P = 0.004), though the difference in blood pressure control was not significant ( P < 0.05) compared with control participants. Analysis of intervention fidelity showed that patients who received the full intervention during months 1 through 6 achieved significantly greater 6- and 12-month improvements in refill adherence and blood pressure control compared with control participants.
AB  - CONCLUSION: A team-based intervention involving community chain pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and novel toolkits led to significant and sustained improvements in refill adherence and SBP in black patients with hypertension.

TI  - Effects of individual physician-level and practice-level financial incentives on hypertension care: a randomized trial.
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Pay for performance is intended to align incentives to promote high-quality care, but results have been contradictory.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the effect of explicit financial incentives to reward guideline-recommended hypertension care.
AB  - DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cluster randomized trial of 12 Veterans Affairs outpatient clinics with 5 performance periods and a 12-month washout that enrolled 83 primary care physicians and 42 nonphysician personnel (eg, nurses, pharmacists).
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Physician-level (individual) incentives, practice-level incentives, both, or none. Intervention participants received up to 5 payments every 4 months; all participants could access feedback reports.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Among a random sample, number of patients achieving guideline-recommended blood pressure thresholds or receiving an appropriate response to uncontrolled blood pressure, number of patients prescribed guideline-recommended medications, and number who developed hypotension.
AB  - RESULTS: Mean (SD) total payments over the study were $4270 ($459), $2672 ($153), and $1648 ($248) for the combined, individual, and practice-level interventions, respectively. The unadjusted baseline and final percentages and the adjusted absolute change over the study in patients meeting the combined blood pressure/appropriate response measure were 75% to 84% and 8.84% (95% CI, 4.20% to 11.80%) for the individual group, 80% to 85% and 3.70% (95% CI, 0.24% to 7.68%) for the practice-level group, 79% to 88% and 5.54% (95% CI, 1.92% to 9.52%) for the combined group, and 86% to 86% and 0.47% (95% CI, -3.12% to 4.04%) for the control group. The adjusted absolute estimated difference in the change between the proportion of patients with blood pressure control/appropriate response for individual incentive and control groups was 8.36% (95% CI, 2.40% to 13.00%; P=.005). The other incentive groups did not show a significant change compared with controls for this outcome. For medications, the unadjusted baseline and final percentages and the adjusted absolute change were 61% to 73% and 9.07% (95% CI, 4.52% to 13.44%), 56% to 65% and 4.98% (95% CI, 0.64% to 10.08%), 65% to 80% and 7.26% (95% CI, 2.92% to 12.48%), and 63% to 72% and 4.35% (95% CI, -0.28% to 9.28%), respectively. These changes in the use of guideline-recommended medications were not significant in any of the incentive groups compared with controls, nor was the incidence of hypotension. The effect of the incentive was not sustained after a washout.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Individual financial incentives, but not practice-level or combined incentives, resulted in greater blood pressure control or appropriate response to uncontrolled blood pressure; none of the incentives resulted in greater use of guideline-recommended medications or increased incidence of hypotension compared with controls. Further research is needed on the factors that contributed to these findings.

TI  - Tailored Case Management for Diabetes and Hypertension (TEACH-DM) in a community population: study design and baseline sample characteristics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite recognition of the benefits associated with well-controlled diabetes and hypertension, control remains suboptimal. Effective interventions for these conditions have been studied within academic settings, but interventions targeting both conditions have rarely been tested in community settings. We describe the design and baseline results of a trial evaluating a behavioral intervention among community patients with poorly-controlled diabetes and comorbid hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: Tailored Case Management for Diabetes and Hypertension (TEACH-DM) is a 24-month randomized, controlled trial evaluating a telephone-delivered behavioral intervention for diabetes and hypertension versus attention control. The study recruited from nine community practices. The nurse-administered intervention targets 3 areas: 1) cultivation of healthful behaviors for diabetes and hypertension control; 2) provision of fundamentals to support attainment of healthful behaviors; and 3) identification and correction of patient-specific barriers to adopting healthful behaviors. Hemoglobin A1c and blood pressure measured at 6, 12, and 24 months are co-primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes include self-efficacy, self-reported medication adherence, exercise, and cost-effectiveness.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 377 randomized patients, 193 were allocated to the intervention and 184 to attention control. The cohort is balanced in terms of gender, race, education level, and income. The cohort's mean baseline hemoglobin A1c and blood pressure are above goal, and mean baseline body mass index falls in the obese range. Baseline self-reported non-adherence is high for diabetes and hypertension medications. Trial results are pending.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: If effective, the TEACH-DM intervention's telephone-based delivery strategy and nurse administration make it well-suited for rapid implementation and broad dissemination in community settings.Copyright © 2013.

TI  - Mobile health (mHealth) based medication adherence measurement - a pilot trial using electronic blisters in diabetes patients.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of the present study was to evaluate a mobile health (mHealth) based remote medication adherence measurement system (mAMS) in elderly patients with increased cardiovascular risk treated for diabetes, high cholesterol and hypertension. Cardiovascular risk was defined as the presence of at least two out of the three risk factors: type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia and hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: For treatment of diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia and hypertension, four predefined routinely used drugs were selected. Drug adherence was investigated in a controlled randomized doctor blinded study with crossover design. The mAMS was used to measure and improve objectively the adherence by means of closed-loop interactions.
AB  - RESULTS: The mean age of the 53 patients (30 female) was 69.4 +/- 4.8 years. A total of 1654 electronic blisters were handed out. A statistically significant difference (P = 0.04) between the monitoring and the control phase was observed for the diabetes medication only. In a post-study questionnaire twenty-nine patients appreciated that their physician knew if and when they had taken their medications and 13 asked for more or automated communication with their physicians. Only one subject withdrew from the study because of technical complexity.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that mHealth based adherence management is feasible and well accepted by patients with increased cardiovascular risk. It may help to increase adherence, even in patients with high baseline adherence and, subsequently, lead to improved control of indicators including blood pressure and cholesterol concentrations. Electronic blisters can be used in a multi-medication regimen but need to be carefully designed for day-to-day application.Copyright © 2013 The British Pharmacological Society.

TI  - Effects of a web-based patient activation intervention to overcome clinical inertia on blood pressure control: cluster randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Only approximately half of patients with hypertension have their blood pressure controlled, due in large part to the tendency of primary care providers (PCPs) not to intensify treatment when blood pressure values are elevated.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study tested the effect of an intervention designed to help patients ask questions at the point of care to encourage PCPs to appropriately intensify blood pressure treatment.
AB  - METHODS: PCPs and their patients with hypertension (N=500) were recruited by letter and randomized into 2 study groups: (1) intervention condition in which patients used a fully automated website each month to receive tailored messages suggesting questions to ask their PCP to improve blood pressure control, and (2) control condition in which a similar tool suggested questions to ask about preventive services (eg, cancer screening). The Web-based tool was designed to be used during each of the 12 study months and before scheduled visits with PCPs. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients in both conditions with controlled blood pressure.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 500 enrolled patients (intervention condition: n=282; control condition: n=218), 418 (83.6%) completed the 12-month follow-up visit. At baseline, 289 (61.5%) of participants had controlled blood pressure. Most (411/500, 82.2%) participants used the intervention during at least 6 of 12 months and 222 (62.5%) reported asking questions directly from the Web-based tool. There were no group differences in asking about medication intensification and there were no differences in blood pressure control after 12 months between the intervention condition (201/282, 71.3%) and control condition (143/218, 65.6%; P=.27) groups. More intervention condition participants discussed having a creatinine test (92, 52.6% vs 49, 35.5%; P=.02) and urine protein test (81, 44.8% vs 21, 14.6%; P<.001), but no group differences were observed in the rate of testing. The control condition participants reported more frequent discussions about tetanus and pneumonia vaccines and reported more tetanus (30, 13.8% vs 15, 5.3%; P=.02) and pneumonia (25, 11.5% vs 16, 5.7%; P=.02) vaccinations after 12 months.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The use of an interactive website designed to overcome clinical inertia for hypertension care did not lead to improvements in blood pressure control. Participant adherence to the intervention was high. The control intervention led to positive changes in the use of preventive services (eg, tetanus immunization) and the intervention condition led to more discussions of hypertension-relevant tests (eg, serum creatinine and urine protein). By providing patients with individually tailored questions to ask during PCP visits, this study demonstrated that participants were likely to discuss the questions with PCPs. These discussions did not, however, lead to improvements in blood pressure control.

TI  - Amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg versus valsartan 160 mg in Chinese hypertensives.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A majority of hypertensives require treatment with >2 antihypertensive therapies to achieve blood pressure (BP) goals. Single-pill combinations (SPC) may improve convenience and adherence to therapy and reduce health care resource use and costs. The antihypertensive effects of amlodipine and valsartan are well established. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg SPC for the treatment of hypertension in predominantly Chinese patients not adequately controlled on valsartan 160 mg alone.
AB  - METHODS: In this multicentre study (24 centres), adults with stage 1 or 2 hypertension not adequately controlled with valsartan monotherapy were randomised to receive double-blind amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg SPC or valsartan 160 mg once daily for 8 weeks.
AB  - RESULTS: The least-square mean change (standard error) from baseline to endpoint in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (MSDBP) at trough, the primary efficacy variable, was -10.3 (0.39) mm Hg with amlodipine/valsartan and -6.6 (0.40) mm Hg with valsartan (difference: -3.7 [0.54] mm Hg, p<0.0001). The corresponding results for mean sitting systolic blood pressure (MSSBP) were -14.9 (0.61) mm Hg and -7.0 (0.61) mm Hg, respectively (difference: -7.9 [0.84] mm Hg, p<0.0001). A significantly greater proportion of patients achieved overall BP control (MSSBP/MSDBP<140/90 mm Hg) with combination therapy (61.3%) versus monotherapy (39.3%; p<0.0001). Both treatments were well tolerated.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Amlodipine/valsartan 5/160 mg SPC is a safe and effective therapy for lowering BP in predominantly Chinese adults with stage 1 or 2 hypertension not adequately controlled with valsartan 160 mg monotherapy.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Utility of a post-hospitalization stroke prevention program managed by nurses.
AB  - GOAL: Evidence-based guidelines exist for the prevention and treatment of patients with cerebral ischemia. Despite these guidelines, there are gaps in clinical practice. Our study aimed to determine if a physician-directed, nurse-case-management program could reduce individual patient vascular risk factors.
AB  - METHODS: Patients hospitalized with atherosclerotic cerebral ischemia with > 1 major uncontrolled risk factor for stroke (hypertension, tobacco use, dyslipidemia, diabetes) were eligible to enroll in our study. Patients were randomized to management by the nurse-prevention program or usual care. Patients in the usual-care group received their initial risk-factor assessment and a scheduled follow-up at 1 year. Patients in the usual-care group underwent further follow-up by primary care and/or neurology as recommended during their hospitalization or outpatient visit. Patients assigned to the prevention group received individualized education, motivational interviewing, and were aided in setting up their risk-factor modification goal plan. Additional education was tailored to each patient based on individualized risk factors. Prevention-group patients also underwent consultation with a registered dietitian and an exercise physiologist. The primary endpoint of the study was improvement of > 1 major patient risk factor for occurrence of stroke to goal at 1 year.
AB  - RESULTS: At 1-year post-hospitalization, patients in the nurse-care-management group were 42% more likely to have met the primary endpoint (n = 18; 61% nurse-managed patients) compared with 33% (n = 18) of patients undergoing usual care (P = 0.09). There was no significant reduction in minor risk factors for either patient group. Patients in the prevention group had greater reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (-38 vs -4; P = 0.0083), changes in cardiovascular risk score (-5.2 vs 1.3; P = 0.0033), and had a greater reductions in systolic blood pressure (-12.2 vs -0.105; P = 0.07) than their usual-care counterparts (changes shown respectively). Patients in the prevention group were more likely to follow a prescribed diet than those in the usual-care group (50% vs 7%, respectively; P = 0.0070) and maintain an exercise program (83% vs 33%, respectively; P = 0.0018).
AB  - SUMMARY: A physician-directed, nurse case-management system for patients post-hospitalization for cerebral ischemia is feasible and may help improve long-term control of major patient risk factors for stroke. A larger trial is needed to verify trends noted in our study.

TI  - Effectiveness of a group education session on adherence with APAP in obstructive sleep apnea--a randomized controlled study.
AB  - PURPOSE: Auto-titrating continuous positive airway pressure (APAP) is an effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). We investigated whether a single group education session on APAP therapy is effective in promoting adherence among patients with OSAHS.
AB  - METHODS: This prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel group study included patients newly diagnosed with OSAHS who met criteria for APAP therapy. Patients were randomized into a study group and a control group. All patients in the study group were assigned to a single group education session, 1 month after beginning APAP therapy.
AB  - RESULTS: We evaluated 146 patients. The median percentage of APAP usage days was 88.3 %, with a median duration per day of use of 6.02 h; 59 % were classified as adherent. Overall, no significant difference in adherence was seen between the study and the control groups. Analyzing patient subgroups, the group session significantly improved APAP adherence among males and patients who were younger (<65 years old), obese (BMI > 35 kg/m(2)), non-sleepy (Epworth sleepiness scale < 11), smokers or past smokers, had hypertension or nocturia and those with non-severe OSAHS.
AB  - CONCLUSION: To maximize the impact of group education sessions and, by that, saving resources, it may be important to select patients likely to benefit from these sessions.

TI  - The role of salt intake and salt sensitivity in the management of hypertension in South Asian people with chronic kidney disease: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of salt restriction to lower blood pressure (BP) in Bangladeshi patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is uncertain.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that a tailored intervention intended to reduce salt intake in addition to standard care will achieve a greater reduction in BP in UK Bangladeshi patients with CKD than standard care alone.
AB  - DESIGN: A randomised parallel-group controlled trial conducted over a 6 month period.
AB  - SETTING: A tertiary renal unit based in acute care hospital in East London.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: 56 adult participants of Bangladeshi origin with CKD and BP >130/80 mm Hg or on antihypertensive medication.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly allocated to receive a tailored low-salt diet or the standard low-salt advice. BP medication, physical activity and weight were monitored.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was change in ambulatory BP. Adherence to dietary advice was assessed by measurement of 24 h urinary salt excretion.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 56 participants randomised, six withdrew at the start of the study. During the study, one intervention group participant died, one control group participant moved to Bangladesh. Data were available for the primary endpoint on 48 participants. Compared with control group the intervention urinary sodium excretion fell from 260 mmol/d to 103 mmol/d (-131 to -76, p<0.001) at 6 months and resulted in mean (95% CI) falls in 24 h systolic/diastolic BP of -8 mm Hg (-11 to -5)/2 (-4 to -2) both p<0.001.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A tailored intervention can achieve moderate salt restriction in patients with CKD, resulting in clinically meaningful falls in BP independent of hypertensive medication.

TI  - The Cholesterol, Hypertension, And Glucose Education (CHANGE) study: results from a randomized controlled trial in African Americans with diabetes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes account for one-third of the mortality difference between African American and white patients. We evaluated the effect of a CVD risk reduction intervention in African Americans with diabetes.
AB  - METHODS: We randomized 359 African Americans with type 2 diabetes to receive usual care or a nurse telephone intervention. The 12-month intervention provided monthly self-management support and quarterly medication management facilitation. Coprimary outcomes were changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) over 12 months. We estimated between-intervention group differences over time using linear mixed-effects models. The secondary outcome was self-reported medication adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: The sample was 72% female; 49% had low health literacy, and 37% had annual income <$10,000. Model-based estimates for mean baseline SBP, HbA1c, and LDL-C were 136.8 mm Hg (95% CI 135.0-138.6), 8.0% (95% CI 7.8-8.2), and 99.1 mg/dL (95% CI 94.7-103.5), respectively. Intervention patients received 9.9 (SD 3.0) intervention calls on average. Primary providers replied to 76% of nurse medication management facilitation contacts, 18% of these resulted in medication changes. There were no between-group differences over time for SBP (P = .11), HbA1c (P = .66), or LDL-C (P = .79). Intervention patients were more likely than those receiving usual care to report improved medication adherence (odds ratio 4.4, 95% CI 1.8-10.6, P = .0008), but adherent patients did not exhibit relative improvement in primary outcomes.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This intervention improved self-reported medication adherence but not CVD risk factor control among African Americans with diabetes. Further research is needed to determine how to maximally impact CVD risk factors in African American patients.Copyright © 2013 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effectiveness of a pharmacist-led drug counseling on enhancing antihypertensive adherence and blood pressure control: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - Adherence to antihypertensive medications represents a crucial success factor for optimal blood pressure (BP) control in clinical practice. This study evaluated whether an additional pharmacist-led medication counseling could achieve better optimal BP control and enhance compliance. In a designated family clinic in a region with similar resident characteristics to Hong Kong, patients taking > one antihypertensive agent with suboptimal compliance were randomly allocated to a brief 3-minute drug advice (control; n=161) or pharmacist counseling (intervention; n=113). The two groups were compared by repeated measure ANOVA at 3-months and 6-months with BP control and medication compliance as outcome variables, respectively. The proportions of patients having optimal compliance increased from 0% to 41.1% at 3 months and 61.9% at 6 months (P<0.001). The proportion of patients having optimal BP control improved from 64.1% at baseline to 74.0% at 3 months and 74.5% at 6 months (P=0.023). There were no significant differences between the two groups in the changes of BP control and compliance levels. This study implied that even a brief 3-minute drug advice might lead to improved BP levels among patients on antihypertensive medications in general practice, but did not demonstrate additional effects by pharmacist counseling.

TI  - Adherence to Mediterranean diet reduces the risk of metabolic syndrome: a 6-year prospective study.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Benefits of Mediterranean diet on MetS risk have been suggested, but overall prospective evidence in the general population is limited. For the first time, the prospective association of adherence to Mediterranean diet with the 6-y risk of MetS and its components was evaluated in a large cohort in Europe.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: Subjects included were participants from the Supplementation en Vitamines et Mineraux AntioXydants (SU.VI.MAX) study. Adherence to Mediterranean diet was assessed using traditional Mediterranean diet score (MDS), an updated Mediterranean score (MED) and Mediterranean style-dietary pattern score (MSDPS) calculated from at least three 24-h records. In 3232 subjects, the association between Mediterranean diet scores and 6-y risk of MetS was evaluated. The association between Mediterranean scores and MetS components was also estimated. A lower risk of MetS was observed with increasing MED score (P-trend = 0.001) and MDS (P-trend = 0.03) in multivariate models. The adjusted odds ratios (95% Confidence Interval) for MetS risk were 0.47 (0.32-0.69) and 0.50 (0.32-0.77) in subjects in the highest versus lowest tertile of MED score and MDS, respectively. The MED score was inversely associated with waist circumference, systolic blood pressure and triglycerides, and directly associated with HDL-cholesterol. The MDS was negatively associated with waist circumference and triglycerides, and MSDPS was positively associated with HDL-cholesterol.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: All Mediterranean diet scores were associated in a potentially beneficial direction with components of MetS or MetS incidence. Our findings support that individuals should be encouraged to follow a Mediterranean dietary pattern for reduction of MetS risk.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of an interdisciplinary education program on hypertension: A pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of this pilot study was to examine the effects of a structured interdisciplinary education program on blood pressure, knowledge, anthropometric measures, medication compliance, behavioural risk factors and quality of life.
AB  - METHOD: In this quasi-experimental study, participants were assigned to an intervention (n = 21) or a regular care group (n = 19). The intervention group attended four weekly sessions related to hypertension. Anthropometric measures and blood pressure were recorded at baseline, one, three and six months for all participants. Both groups completed questionnaires on knowledge, health-related behaviours and quality of life at these same intervals.
AB  - RESULTS: The reduction in systolic blood pressure was greater in the intervention group than in the regular care group (p = 0.05). However, there were no between group differences with regard to the other variables studied.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Participation in a structured interdisciplinary education program was associated with a reduction of systolic blood pressure, thus contributing to a risk reduction for cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Antihypertensive response to combination of olmesartan and amlodipine does not depend on method and time of drug administration.
AB  - Fixed combinations of antihypertensive drugs have the potentiality to improve blood pressure (BP) control. However, when pharmacokinetic parameters of the two drugs are different, both method and time of administration of the two drugs may modify the antihypertensive response. In an open-label, single-blind, randomized study we compared antihypertensive effect of four administration schemes of a combination therapy of olmesartan and amlodipine in the same group of hypertensive patients, using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). The olmesartan + amlodipine combination has demonstrated to provide a good control of BP, with systolic and diastolic BP constantly below 130 and 85 mmHg over the 24 h. The simultaneous or separate administration of the 2 drugs fully overlapped, suggesting that the fixed combination and the separate administration induce a similar and sustained BP control.

TI  - Hypertensive patients' experience with adherence therapy for enhancing medication compliance: a qualitative exploration.
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the experience of non-compliant hypertensive patients who had received seven sessions of adherence therapy (AT) as part of a randomised controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: AT is a patient-centred approach used to explore patient attitudes, beliefs and discrepancy toward medications that aimed to enhance patients' medication-taking behaviour.
AB  - DESIGN: Qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with patients who had completed an AT intervention.
AB  - METHODS: A convenience sample of 10 hypertensive patients who received AT as part of an exploratory randomised controlled trial (ISRCTN99494659) were included. Thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews exploring patient's views and experiences of AT was used.
AB  - RESULTS: Five major themes of AT emerged; modifying attitudes and beliefs, positive impact on self efficacy, therapist motivation, positive impact on well-being and a well-designed intervention.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: patients' views about the benefit of AT were entirely consistent with our proposed mechanism of action for this intervention; that is by improving patient's beliefs and attitudes regarding taking drugs, and finding solutions to barriers that prevent adherence, patients become more complaint with their medication which in turn has a positive impact on clinical outcomes [i.e. blood pressure, hypertension complication (stroke, myocardial infarction, and recurrent hospitalisation)].
AB  - RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Exploring patients' experience with AT and recognising these five elements help in tailoring a new effective strategy according to individual needs for enhancing adherence to prescribed drugs.Copyright © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Virgin olive oil supplementation and long-term cognition: the PREDIMED-NAVARRA randomized, trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect on cognition of a controlled intervention testing Mediterranean diets (MedDiet).
AB  - DESIGN: Randomized trial after 6.5 years of nutritional intervention.
AB  - SETTING: Eight primary care centers affiliated to the University of Navarra.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: A random subsample of 285 participants (95 randomly allocated to each of 3 groups) of the PREDIMED-NAVARRA trial. All of them were at high vascular risk (44.8% men, 74.1+/-5.7 years at cognitive evaluation).
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Nutritional intervention comparing two MedDiets (supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil [EVOO] or mixed nuts) versus a low-fat control diet. Participants received intensive education to increase adherence to the intended intervention. Participants allocated to the MedDiet groups received EVOO (1 l/week) or 30 g/day of mixed nuts. Dietary habits were evaluated using a validated 137-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Additionally, adherence to MedDiet was appraised using a 14-item questionnaire both at baseline and yearly thereafter.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: Cognitive performance as a main outcome and cognitive status (normal, mild cognitive impairment [MCI] or dementia) as a secondary outcome were evaluated by two neurologists blinded to group assignment after 6.5 years of nutritional intervention.
AB  - RESULTS: Better post-trial cognitive performance versus control in all cognitive domains and significantly better performance across fluency and memory tasks were observed for participants allocated to the MedDiet+EVOO group. After adjustment for sex, age, education, apolipoprotein E genotype, family history of cognitive impairment/dementia, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes, alcohol and total energy intake, this group also showed lower MCI (OR=0.34 95% CI: 0.12-0.97) compared with control group. Participants assigned to MedDiet+Nuts group did not differ from controls.
AB  - CONCLUSION: A long-term intervention with an EVOO-rich MedDiet resulted in a better cognitive function in comparison with a control diet. However, non-significant differences were found for most cognitive domains. Participants allocated to an EVOO-rich MedDiet had less MCI than controls.

TI  - Reducing cardiovascular medication complexity in a German university hospital: effects of a structured pharmaceutical management intervention on adherence.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient adherence is necessary for successful medication therapy. However, highly complex medication regimens may lead to poor adherence, which decreases the effectiveness of treatment and often results in treatment failure, excessive morbidity and mortality, and higher costs.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether patient adherence can be increased indirectly through reducing medication complexity by (a) pharmaceutical counseling of hospital medical staff and (b) additional information in the discharge letter for the primary care provider (PCP) about the simplified discharge medication.
AB  - METHODS: At the Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, a tertiary care university hospital in Germany, 240 chronically ill inpatients with hypertension, diabetes, and/or dyslipidemia were enrolled in this prospective, semirandomized study. For the intervention group, hospital doctors were counseled by a clinical pharmacist on feasible simplifications of cardiovascular and antidiabetic medications. In 1 randomized subgroup, the PCP received additional explanatory information in the discharge letter. Adherence (self-reporting using the Medication Adherence Rating Scale [MARS-D]) and medication complexity (using the Medication Regimen Complexity Index [MRCI-D]) were recorded at admission to the hospital, discharge from the hospital, and 6 weeks after discharge. Patient quality of life (QoL) and satisfaction with information about medications were assessed at admission and after discharge.
AB  - RESULTS: At discharge, the medication regimen in the intervention group was significantly less complex than in the comparison group. Yet, 6 weeks  after discharge, the complexity of the outpatient medication had increased to values similar to the comparison group, unless the PCP received additional information in the discharge letter. Propensity adjusted complete adherence rates at discharge were slightly, but not significantly, higher in the intervention group than in the comparison group. Within the intervention group, complete adherence was more frequent in the subgroup with additional information for the PCP. Patient QoL and satisfaction with information were comparable in both groups.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The complexity of cardiovascular and antidiabetic hospital medications can be reduced by counseling the hospital doctors. However, for a sustainable simplification of outpatient medication, the PCPs must receive explicit information about the modifications. Patient adherence was not significantly influenced by this intervention. To verify these results, further research with objective measures of adherence and in patients with other diseases is needed.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of two ramipril and hydrochlorothiazide fixed-dose combination formulations in adults with stage 1 or stage 2 arterial hypertension evaluated by using ABPM.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fixed-dose combinations of antihypertensive agents demonstrate advantages in terms of efficacy, tolerability, and treatment adherence.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of 2 ramipril and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) fixed-dose combinations in patients with hypertension stage 1 or 2. Patients' blood pressure (BP) profiles were evaluated by using 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM).
AB  - METHODS: This was a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, noninferiority trial of adult patients (age >18 years) with hypertension stage 1 or 2 and systolic blood pressure (SBP) within 140 to 179 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 90 to 109 mm Hg. After a 2-week washout period, eligible patients were randomized to receive 1 of 2 ramipril/HCTZ fixed-dose combination formulations (5/25 mg/d) for 8 weeks. The primary end point was the difference in 24-hour ABPM SBP/DBP mean reductions between groups after 8 weeks of treatment. The secondary end points were the changes in daytime and nighttime ABPM and in office BP. Safety profile and tolerability assessments included monitoring of adverse events.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 102 patients with hypertension (54 in group A [test formulation] and 48 in group B [reference formulation]), aged 27 to 85 years, completed the 8-week treatment period. The decreases in SBP and DBP according to 24-hour ABPM from baseline to week 8 were significant and similar in both groups. SBP decreased from 149.1 to 133.0 mm Hg (-16.1 mm Hg) in group A and from 146.2 to 130.6 mm Hg in group B (-15.6 mm Hg) (P = 0.8537); DBP was reduced by 8.8 mm Hg in group A and by 8.5 mm Hg in group B (P = 0.8748). Because the lower 95% CI limit for the difference between groups A and B of 3.96 mm Hg in SBP and 3.54 mm Hg in DBP was lower than that preestablished by the trial protocol (4 mm Hg), noninferiority of the test formulation was demonstrated compared with the reference formulation. For the secondary end points, there was no significant difference between groups in SBP and DBP during daytime or nighttime at the end of week 8. Office BP was significantly reduced in both treatment groups, with no significant differences between groups. The incidence of adverse events was 23.7% in group A and 21.7% in group B.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Both treatment options were well tolerated and equally reduced BP. The results support the conclusion that group A (new fixed-dose combination of ramipril/HCTZ) was noninferior to group B (reference medication in Brazil).

TI  - Tailored interventions to improve hypertension management after stroke or TIA--phase II (TIMS II).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reduction of blood pressure (BP) after stroke or TIA decreases stroke recurrence and is a major goal ofsecondary Stroke Prevention Clinics (SPCs). Health care providers need effective screening processes to identify those clients at highest risk of not achieving BP targets and those clients at highest risk ofnon-adherence to medication.
AB  - METHODS: This multicentred, randomized controlled study used a screening process to identify SPC patients with psychosocial/cognitive deficits (e.g., lack of confidence in the utility of medications, poor memory, mild cognitive impairment) who were experiencing difficulty managing their BP to target values and evaluated whether a model of nurse-led case management program (monthly telephone calls, motivational interviewingfor lifestyle change, plus home BP monitoring and use ofdosettes for medication administration) would improve BP measures and adherence to medications.
AB  - RESULTS: Both intervention (n=29) and usual care groups (n=27) showed a trend-for'reduced BP at six months (Median ql-q3, Systolic BR p=0.46; Diastolic BR p=0.37). Diabetic patients, irrespective of the group to which they were randomized, were less likely to meet Best Practice Guideline targets than those without diabetes (Chi Square test, p=0.0001).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Stroke and TIA patients with diabetes may require additional resources and support in order to reach BP target values.

TI  - Pilot trial of a licensed practical nurse intervention for hypertension and depression.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Depression is a risk factor for hypertension, and risk of depression is increased substantially in patients with hypertension. Our objective was to examine whether an intervention carried out by Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs) integrating depression treatment into care for hypertension improved blood pressure control and depressive symptoms.
AB  - METHODS: In all, 60 patients ages 41 to 92 years with hypertension and depressive symptoms at a large primary care practice in Philadelphia were randomly assigned to an integrated care intervention carried out by LPNs (n=30) or usual care (n=30). Intervention and control groups did not differ statistically on baseline measures. Outcomes assessed at baseline and 12 weeks included standard laboratory procedures to measure blood pressure control and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to assess depression.
AB  - RESULTS: Patients in the integrated care intervention had lower diastolic blood pressure (intervention 74.2 mmHg versus usual care 82.0 mmHg) and fewer depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 mean scores, intervention 2.4 versus usual care 7.1) compared with patients in the usual care group at 12 weeks after adjustment for baseline values. Patients in the integrated care intervention also had lower systolic blood pressure (intervention 130.0 mmHg versus usual care 140.6 mmHg) compared with patients in the usual care group at 12 weeks although the results approached but did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Training existing primary care practice office staff will facilitate implementation in real world practices with limited resources and competing demands.

TI  - Favourable effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet on glucose tolerance and lipid profiles in gestational diabetes: a randomised clinical trial.
AB  - Although gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with an increased risk of maternal and neonatal morbidity, there is no consensus as to the optimal approach of nutritional management in these patients. The present study was designed to assess the effect of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan on glucose tolerance and lipid profiles of pregnant women with GDM. The present randomised controlled clinical trial was performed among thirty-four women diagnosed with GDM at 24-28 weeks of gestation. Subjects were randomly assigned to consume either the control diet (n 17) or the DASH eating pattern (n 17) for 4 weeks. The control diet was designed to contain 45-55% carbohydrates, 15-20% protein and 25-30% total fat. The macronutrient composition of the DASH diet was similar to the control diet; however, the DASH diet was rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy products, and contained lower amounts of saturated fats, cholesterol and refined grains with a total of 2400 mg Na/d. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after 4 weeks of intervention to measure fasting plasma glucose, glycated Hb (HbA1c) and lipid profiles. Participants underwent a 3 h oral glucose tolerance tests and blood samples were collected at 60, 120 and 180 min to measure plasma glucose levels. Adherence to the DASH eating pattern, compared with the control diet, resulted in improved glucose tolerance such that plasma glucose levels reduced at 60 (21.86 v. 20.45 mmol/l, Pgroup = 0.02), 120 (22.3 v. 0.2 mmol/l, Pgroup = 0.001) and 180 min (21.7 v. 0.22 mmol/l, Pgroup = 0.002) after the glucose load. Decreased HbA1c levels (20.2 v. 0.05 %, Pgroup = 0.001) was also seen in the DASH group compared with the control group. Mean changes for serum total (20.42 v. 0.31 mmol/l, Pgroup = 0.01) and LDL-cholesterol (20.47 v. 0.22 mmol/l, Pgroup = 0.005), TAG (20.17 v. 0.34 mmol/l, Pgroup = 0.01) and total:HDL-cholesterol ratio (20.6 (SD 0.9) v. 0.3 (SD 0.8), Pgroup = 0.008) were significantly different between the two diets. Additionally, consumption of the DASH diet favourably influenced systolic blood pressure (22.6 v. 1.7 mmHg, Pgroup = 0.001). Mean changes of fasting plasma glucose (20.29 v. 0.15 mmol/l, Pgroup = 0.09) were nonsignificant comparing the DASH diet with the control diet. In conclusion, consumption of the DASH eating pattern for 4 weeks among pregnant women with GDM resulted in beneficial effects on glucose tolerance and lipid profiles compared with the control diet.

TI  - Thromboembolic event rate in paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation: data from the GISSI-AF trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few data on the thromboembolic (TE) risk of paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) are available. This study aimed to assess the incidence of TE events in paroxysmal and persistent AF.
AB  - METHODS: We performed a subset post hoc analysis of 771 patients with paroxysmal and 463 with persistent AF enrolled in the multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled GISSI-AF trial - comparing the efficacy of valsartan versus placebo in preventing AF recurrences - where the choice of antithrombotic treatment was left to the judgment of the referring physician. TE and major outcome events were centrally validated. AF recurrences were detected by frequent clinic visits and a transtelephonic monitoring device with weekly and symptomatic transmissions.
AB  - RESULTS: Eighty-five percent of patients had a history of hypertension, and the 7.7% had heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, or both. The mean CHADS2 score was 1.41+/-0.84. TE and major bleeding events were observed at a low incidence among the overall population at 1-year follow-up (0.97% and 0.81%, respectively). The univariate and multivariable analyses revealed no statistically significant differences in the incidence of TE, major bleeding events or mortality in paroxysmal and persistent AF patients. TE events were more common among women than men (p=0.02). The follow-up examination showed under- or overtreatment with warfarin in many patients, according to guideline suggestions. Warfarin was more frequently prescribed to patients with persistent AF (p<0.0001) and patients with AF recurrences (p<0.0001). AF recurrences were noninvasively detected in 632 (51.2%) patients. In patients without AF recurrences, the TE event rate was 0.5% versus 1.74%, 1.28%, and 1.18% for those with only symptomatic, only asymptomatic or both symptomatic and asymptomatic AF recurrences, respectively, but the difference was not statistically significant, even after adjusting for warfarin treatment and the CHADS2 score (HR 2.93; CI 95%; 0.8-10.9; p=0.11).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: TE and major bleeding events showed a very low incidence in the GISSI-AF trial population, despite under- or overtreatment with warfarin in many patients. TE events had a similar rate in paroxysmal and persistent AF.

TI  - The Trial Using Motivational Interviewing and Positive Affect and Self-Affirmation in African-Americans with Hypertension (TRIUMPH): from theory to clinical trial implementation.
AB  - This paper describes the application of a translational research model in developing The Trial Using Motivational Interviewing and Positive Affect and Self-Affirmation in African-Americans with Hypertension (TRIUMPH), a theoretically-based, randomized controlled trial. TRIUMPH targets blood pressure control among African-Americans with hypertension in a community health center and public hospital setting. TRIUMPH applies positive affect, self-affirmation, and motivational interviewing as strategies to increase medication adherence and blood pressure control. A total of 220 participants were recruited in TRIUMPH and are currently being followed. This paper provides a detailed description of the theoretical framework and study design of TRIUMPH and concludes with a critical reflection of the lessons learned in the process of implementing a health behavior intervention in a community-based setting. TRIUMPH provides a model for incorporating the translational science research paradigm to conducting pragmatic behavioral trials in a real-world setting in a vulnerable population. Lessons learned through interactions with our community partners reinforce the value of community engagement in research.Copyright © 2013. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Translating basic behavioral and social science research to clinical application: the EVOLVE mixed methods approach.[Erratum appears in J Consult Clin Psychol. 2013 Apr;81(2):230]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a mixed-methods approach to develop and test a basic behavioral science-informed intervention to motivate behavior change in 3 high-risk clinical populations. Our theoretically derived intervention comprised a combination of positive affect and self-affirmation (PA/SA), which we applied to 3 clinical chronic disease populations.
AB  - METHOD: We employed a sequential mixed methods model (EVOLVE) to design and test the PA/SA intervention in order to increase physical activity in people with coronary artery disease (post-percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]) or asthma (ASM) and to improve medication adherence in African Americans with hypertension (HTN). In an initial qualitative phase, we explored participant values and beliefs. We next pilot tested and refined the intervention and then conducted 3 randomized controlled trials with parallel study design. Participants were randomized to combined PA/SA versus an informational control and were followed bimonthly for 12 months, assessing for health behaviors and interval medical events.
AB  - RESULTS: Over 4.5 years, we enrolled 1,056 participants. Changes were sequentially made to the intervention during the qualitative and pilot phases. The 3 randomized controlled trials enrolled 242 participants who had undergone PCI, 258 with ASM, and 256 with HTN (n = 756). Overall, 45.1% of PA/SA participants versus 33.6% of informational control participants achieved successful behavior change (p = .001). In multivariate analysis, PA/SA intervention remained a significant predictor of achieving behavior change (p < .002, odds ratio = 1.66), 95% CI [1.22, 2.27], controlling for baseline negative affect, comorbidity, gender, race/ethnicity, medical events, smoking, and age.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The EVOLVE method is a means by which basic behavioral science research can be translated into efficacious interventions for chronic disease populations.

TI  - Blood pressure control and treatment adherence in hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome: protocol of a randomized controlled study based on home blood pressure telemonitoring vs. conventional management and assessment of psychological determinants of adherence (TELEBPMET Study).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inadequate blood pressure control and poor adherence to treatment remain among the major limitations in the management of hypertensive patients, particularly of those at high risk of cardiovascular events. Preliminary evidence suggests that home blood pressure telemonitoring (HBPT) might help increasing the chance of achieving blood pressure targets and improve patient's therapeutic adherence. However, all these potential advantages of HBPT have not yet been fully investigated.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: The purpose of this open label, parallel group, randomized, controlled study is to assess whether, in patients with high cardiovascular risk (treated or untreated essential arterial hypertension--both in the office and in ambulatory conditions over 24 h--and metabolic syndrome), long-term (48 weeks) blood pressure control is more effective when based on HBPT and on the feedback to patients by their doctor between visits, or when based exclusively on blood pressure determination during quarterly office visits (conventional management (CM)). A total of 252 patients will be enrolled and randomized to usual care (n = 84) or HBPT (n = 168). The primary study endpoint will be the rate of subjects achieving normal daytime ambulatory blood pressure targets (< 135/85 mmHg) 24 weeks and 48 weeks after randomization. In addition, the study will assess the psychological determinants of adherence and persistence to drug therapy, through specific psychological tests administered during the course of the study. Other secondary study endpoints will be related to the impact of HBPT on additional clinical and economic outcomes (number of additional medical visits, direct costs of patient management, number of antihypertensive drugs prescribed, level of cardiovascular risk, degree of target organ damage and rate of cardiovascular events, regression of the metabolic syndrome).
AB  - DISCUSSION: The TELEBPMET Study will show whether HBPT is effective in improving blood pressure control and related medical and economic outcomes in hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome. It will also provide a comprehensive understanding of the psychological determinants of medication adherence and blood pressure control of these patients.

TI  - Providers' perspective on diabetes case management: a descriptive study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To address the physicians' perspective on case management (CM) for diabetes.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A nested descriptive study in a randomized controlled trial of diabetic patients who had blood pressure >140/90 mm Hg, glycated hemoglobin >9.0%, or lowdensity lipoprotein level >100 mg/dL. Patients received CM (n = 278) versus usual care over a period of 1 year. Surveys were designed to assess physicians' comfort in working with case managers. At the end of the study physicians whose patients were randomized in the trial were mailed these surveys.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 51 of the 72 providers completed the survey (70.8% response rate). The majority of the providers felt very comfortable working with case managers (91.5 %), found treatment provided by CM to be accurate (93.3%),reported that having case managers increased the likelihood of adherence to the treatment regimens (89.4%), and reported overall improved patient satisfaction with CM (93.5%). Seventy-four percent of the providers reported that working with case managers increased the number of patients who were able to achieve therapeutic goals. Almost all providers (99.74%) reported that they will likely consult case managers for management of poorly controlled diabetes.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Co-managing diabetes patients with nurse case managers did not undermine the providers' perceived professional role. In fact, having CM increased the rate of achieving therapeutic goals among patients with diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors.

TI  - Factors associated with non-adherence to three hypertension self-management behaviors: preliminary data for a new instrument.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinicians have difficulty in identifying patients that are unlikely to adhere to hypertension self-management. Identifying non-adherence is essential to addressing suboptimal blood pressure control and high costs.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: 1) To identify risk factors associated with non-adherence to three key self-management behaviors in patients with hypertension: proper medication use, diet, and exercise; 2) To evaluate the extent to which an instrument designed to identify the number of risk factors present for non-adherence to each of the three hypertension self-management behaviors would be associated with self-management non-adherence and blood pressure.
AB  - DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of randomized trial data.
AB  - PATIENTS: Six hundred and thirty-six primary care patients with hypertension.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: 1) Demographic, socioeconomic, psychosocial, and health belief-related factors; 2) measures of self-reported adherence to recommended medication use, diet recommendations, and exercise recommendations, all collected at baseline assessment; 3) systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
AB  - RESULTS: We identified patient factors associated with measures of non-adherence to medications, diet, and exercise in hypertension. We then combined risk factors associated with >1 adherence measure into an instrument that generated three composite variables (medication, diet, and exercise composites), reflecting the number of risk factors present for non-adherence to the corresponding self-management behavior. These composite variables identified subgroups with higher likelihood of medication non-adherence, difficulty following diet recommendations, and difficulty following exercise recommendations. Composite variable levels representing the highest number of self-management non-adherence risk factors were associated with higher SBP and DBP.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: We identified factors associated with measures of non-adherence to recommended medication use, diet, and exercise in hypertension. We then developed an instrument that was associated with non-adherence to these self-management behaviors, as well as with blood pressure. With further study, this instrument has potential to improve identification of non-adherent patients with hypertension.

TI  - Sustained blood pressure-lowering effect of aliskiren compared with telmisartan after a single missed dose.
AB  - Poor adherence to antihypertensive drug treatment is common and is often associated with marked prolongations of the dosing interval. Hence, selecting a treatment that has the potential to provide a sustained blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect is important. The objective of this analysis is to compare the sustained efficacy of aliskiren with telmisartan after a single missed dose. This is part of a 12-week double-blind study conducted in patients with mild to moderate hypertension randomized to once-daily aliskiren 150 mg or telmisartan 40 mg for 2 weeks, force-titrated to double the doses for 10 weeks, followed by placebo for 1 week. The changes in BP from the end of active treatment (EOA) to 48 hours after treatment withdrawal (day 2) were analyzed. Demographic and baseline characteristics were comparable between the treatment groups. Aliskiren continued to show significantly greater reductions in mean sitting systolic BP (-0.7 vs +1.3 mm Hg; P<.05), 24-hour mean ambulatory systolic BP (-3.6 vs +2.6 mm Hg; P<.01), and 24-hour mean ambulatory diastolic BP (-3.7 vs +0.4 mm Hg; P<.01) compared with telmisartan from EOA to day 2, despite the similar BP reductions from randomization to EOA. In conclusion, aliskiren sustained the BP-lowering efficacy better than telmisartan after a single missed dose.Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - A multifaceted prospective memory intervention to improve medication adherence: design of a randomized control trial.
AB  - Adherence to prescribed antihypertensive agents is critical because control of elevated blood pressure is the single most important way to prevent stroke and other end organ damage. Unfortunately, nonadherence remains a significant problem. Previous interventions designed to improve adherence have demonstrated only small benefits of strategies that target single facets such as understanding medication directions. The intervention described here is informed by prospective memory theory and performance of older adults in laboratory-based paradigms and uses a comprehensive, multifaceted approach to improve adherence. It incorporates multiple strategies designed to support key components of prospective remembering involved in taking medication. The intervention is delivered by nurses in the home with an education control group for comparison. Differences between groups in overall adherence following the intervention and 6 months later will be tested. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels also will be examined between groups and as they relate to adherence. Intra-individual regression is planned to examine change in adherence over time and its predictors. Finally, we will examine the association between executive function/working memory and adherence, predicting that adherence will be related to executive/working memory in the control group but not in the intervention group.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - The Nigerian antihypertensive adherence trial: a community-based randomized trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research in industrialized countries has demonstrated that a key factor limiting the control of hypertension is poor patient adherence and that the most successful interventions for long-term adherence employ multiple strategies. Very little data exist on this question in low-income countries, wherein medication-taking behavior may be less well developed.
AB  - METHOD: We conducted a treatment adherence trial of 544 patients [mean age ~63 years, mean blood pressure (BP) ~168/92 mmHg] with previously untreated hypertension in urban and rural Nigeria. Eligible participants were randomized to one of two arms: clinic management only, or clinic management and home visits. Both interventions included three elements: a community based, nurse-led treatment program with physician backup; facilitation of clinic visits and health education; and the use of diuretics and a beta blocker as needed. After initial diagnosis, the management protocol was implemented by a nurse with physician backup. Participants were evaluated monthly for 6 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Medication adherence was assessed with pill count and urine testing. Drop-out rates, by treatment group, ranged from 12 to 28%. Among participants who completed the 6-month trial, overall adherence was high (~77% of participants took >98% of prescribed pills). Adherence did not differ by treatment arm, but was better at the rural than the urban site and among those with higher baseline BP. Hypertension control (BP <140/90 mmHg) was achieved in approximately 66% of participants at 6 months.
AB  - CONCLUSION: This community-based intervention confirms relatively modest default rates compared with industrialized societies, and suggests that medication adherence can be high in developing world settings in clinic attenders.

TI  - Efficacy of moxibustion for pre- or stage I hypertension: study protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and the prevalence of hypertension tends to increase with age. Current treatments for hypertension have adverse side effects and poor adherence. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of moxibustion on blood pressure in individuals with pre- or stage I hypertension.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: Forty-five subjects with pre- or stage I hypertension will be randomized into three groups: treatment group A (2 times/week), treatment group B (3 times/week), and the control group (non-treated group). The inclusion criteria will be as follows: (1) aged between 19 and 65 years; (2) prehypertension or stage I hypertension (JNC 7, Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure); (3) the participants are volunteers and written consent obtained.The participants in the treatment group A will undergo indirect moxibustion 2 times per week for 4 weeks, and the participants in the treatment group B will undergo indirect moxibustion 3 times per week for 4 weeks. The participants in the control group (non-treated group) will maintain their current lifestyle, including diet and exercise. The use of antihypertensive medication is not permitted. The primary endpoint will be a change in patient blood pressure. The secondary endpoints will be the body mass index, lipid profile, EuroQol and Heart Rate Variability. The data will be analyzed with the Student's t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) (p < 0.05).
AB  - DISCUSSION: The results of this study will help to establish the optimal approach for the care of adults with pre- or stage I hypertension.

TI  - Protocol for a randomised controlled trial to estimate the effects and costs of a patient centred educational intervention in glaucoma management.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor glaucoma education is thought to be a causative factor of non-adherence to glaucoma therapy. However, the multi-factorial nature of non-adherent behaviour may explain the failure of purely educational interventions to achieve significant improvement in adherence. Behaviour Change Counselling (BCC) allows both the imparting of information and assessment of patient ambivalence to medication use and may elicit behaviour change in order to achieve better adherence. The chronic and complex nature of glaucoma means that patient non-adherence to glaucoma therapy does not easily correlate with measureable objective clinical endpoints. However, electronic medication monitoring offers an objective method of measuring adherence without reliance on clinical endpoints.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with glaucoma (open angle) or ocular hypertension patients attending a glaucoma clinic and prescribed travoprost. The study will determine whether additional glaucoma education using BCC is beneficial and cost effective in improving adherence with glaucoma therapy. An 8-month follow-up period, using an electronic adherence monitoring device (Travalert dosing aid, TDA), will indicate if the intervention is likely to be sustained in the longer term. Additionally, a cost-effectiveness framework will be used to estimate the cost benefit of improving adherence. The development of a novel intervention to deliver glaucoma education using BCC required practitioner training and fidelity testing. Five practitioners were successfully trained to become Glaucoma Support Assistants able to deliver the BCC intervention. The research group had prior clinical and investigative experience in this setting, and used multiple strategies to design a method to address the study objectives.
AB  - DISCUSSION: This RCT, using BCC to improve adherence to ocular hypotensive therapy, to our knowledge is the first within this disease area. Using a variety of adherence measures allows examination of the known inaccuracies of patient self-report with respect to glaucoma medication. The novel BCC component has undergone fidelity testing using BECCI and the BCC template will ensure conformity to a standardised intervention.

TI  - Effectiveness of a short message reminder in increasing compliance with pediatric cataract treatment: a randomized trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Regular follow-up is essential to successful management of childhood cataract. We sought to assess whether a mobile phone short message service (SMS) for parents of children with cataract could improve follow-up adherence and the proportion of procedures performed in timely fashion.
AB  - DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01417819.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: We included 258 parent-child pairs involved in the Childhood Cataract Program of the Chinese Ministry of Health.
AB  - METHODS: Participants were randomized (1:1) to a mobile phone SMS intervention or standard follow-up appointments. All participants were scheduled to attend > 4 follow-up appointments according to the protocol. Parents in the intervention group received SMS automated reminders before scheduled appointments. The control group parents did not receive SMSs or any alternative reminder of scheduled appointments. Regular ocular examinations and analyses were performed by investigators masked to group allocation; however, study participants and the manager in charge of randomization and sending SMSs were not masked.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of follow-up appointments attended, additional surgeries, laser treatments, changes in eyeglasses prescription, and occurrence of secondary ocular hypertension.
AB  - RESULTS: Among parent-child participants, 135 were randomly assigned to the SMS intervention and 123 to standard appointments. Attendance rates for the SMS group (first visit, 97.8%; second, 91.9%; third, 92.6%; fourth, 83%) were significantly higher than those for the control group (first visit, 87.8%; second, 69.9%; third, 56.9%; fourth, 33.3%). The increase in attendance rate for total number of follow-up visits with SMS reminders was 47.2% (relative risk [RR] for attendance, 1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-1.78; P = 0.003). The number needed to remind (NNR) to gain 1 additional visit by 1 child was 3 (95% CI, 1.8-4.2). A total of 247 clinical interventions were carried out in the SMS group and 134 in the control group (RR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.37-1.99; P = 0.007). The NNR to result in 1 additional clinical intervention was 5 (95% CI, 3.5-6.5).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The SMS reminders significantly improved follow-up adherence in pediatric cataract treatment. Using readily available mobile phone resources may be an effective and economic strategy to improve management of childhood cataract in China.

TI  - The MAURO study: baseline characteristics and compliance with guidelines targets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Multiple Intervention and Audit in Renal Diseases to Optimize Care (MAURO) study was a cluster randomized controlled trial in 22 renal clinics which aimed to assess the efficacy of a multimodal quality improvement intervention to increase compliance with guideline recommendations for prevention of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and cardiovascular (CV) complications. The trial aimed to test whether this multimodal intervention improved adherence to recommended targets for a series of surrogate indicators relevant to blood pressure (BP) control, sodium intake, proteinuria, dyslipidemia, anemia and calcium-phosphate alterations. The trial also tested whether the same intervention slowed CKD progression and prevented CV complications in CKD patients.
AB  - METHOD: Twenty-two renal clinics were randomized to 2 arms: an intervention arm applying a multimethod quality improvement intervention and a control arm providing standard care. Surrogate indicators were measured to evaluate blood pressure (BP) control, sodium intake, proteinuria, dyslipidemia, anemia and calcium-phosphate alterations.
AB  - RESULTS: Notwithstanding the fact that the vast majority of patients enrolled in this study (95%) were being treated with antihypertensive drugs, BP goals at baseline (specific for proteinuria level and diabetes) were met only in 45% of nonproteinuric patients and in just 14% and 18% of proteinuric and diabetic patients, respectively. The use of diuretics in hypertensive patients was less than what was needed, and about 80% of patients showed a salt excretion >100 mmol/24 hours. Total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were out of target in over 40% of patients, but only about 60% of these were on statins. A large majority of CKD patients were obese or overweight. The proportion of smokers was relatively small (13%), and 37% of patients had quit smoking, indicating patients' awareness of the health risks of smoking.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, management of modifiable risk factors for CKD progression and CV disease could be substantially improved.

TI  - Financial incentives and physician commitment to guideline-recommended hypertension management.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the impact of financial incentives on physician goal commitment to guideline-recommended hypertension care.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Clinic-level cluster-randomized trial with 4 arms: individual, group, or combined incentives, and control.
AB  - METHODS: A total of 83 full-time primary care physicians at 12 Veterans Affairs medical centers completed web-based surveys measuring their goal commitment to guideline-recommended hypertension care every 4 months and telephone interviews at months 8 and 16. Intervention arm participants received performance-based incentives every 4 months for 5 periods. All participants received guideline education at baseline and audit and feedback every 4 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Physician goal commitment did not vary over time or across arms. Participants reported patient nonadherence was a perceived barrier and consistent follow-up was a perceived facilitator to successful hypertension care, suggesting that providers may perceive hypertension management as more of a patient responsibility (external locus of control).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Financial incentives may constitute an insufficiently strong intervention to influence goal commitment when providers attribute performance to external forces beyond their control.

TI  - Determinants and consequences of adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension diet in African-American and white adults with high blood pressure: results from the ENCORE trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is an accepted nonpharmacologic treatment for hypertension, little is known about what patient characteristics affect dietary adherence and what level of adherence is needed to reduce blood pressure (BP).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine what factors predict dietary adherence and the extent to which dietary adherence is necessary to produce clinically meaningful BP reductions.
AB  - DESIGN: Ancillary study of the ENCORE (Exercise and Nutrition Interventions for Cardiovascular Health) trial--a 16-week randomized clinical trial of diet and exercise.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Participants included 144 sedentary, overweight, or obese adults (body mass index 25 to 39.9) with high BP (systolic 130 to 159 mm Hg and/or diastolic 85 to 99 mm Hg).
AB  - INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to one of three groups: DASH diet alone, DASH diet plus weight management, and Usual Diet Controls.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Our primary outcomes were a composite index of adherence to the DASH diet and clinic BP.
AB  - STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: General linear models were used to compare treatment groups on post-treatment adherence to the DASH diet. Linear regression was used to examine potential predictors of post-treatment DASH adherence. Analysis of covariance was used to examine the relation of adherence to the DASH diet and BP.
AB  - RESULTS: Participants in the DASH diet plus weight management (16.1 systolic BP [SBP]; 95% CI 13.0 to 19.2 mm Hg and 9.9 diastolic BP [DBP]; 95% CI 8.1 to 11.6 mm Hg) and DASH diet alone (11.2 SBP; 95% CI 8.1 to 14.3 mm Hg and 7.5 DBP; 95% CI 5.8 to 9.3 mm Hg) groups showed significant reductions in BP in comparison with Usual Diet Controls participants (3.4 SBP; 95% CI 0.4 to 6.4 mm Hg and DBP 3.8; 95% CI 2.2 to 5.5 mm Hg). Greater post-treatment consumption of DASH foods was noted in both the DASH diet alone (mean = 6.20; 95% CI 5.83 to 6.57) and DASH diet plus weight management groups (mean = 6.23; 95% CI 5.88 to 6.59) compared with Usual Diet Controls (mean = 3.66; 95% CI 3.30 to 4.01; P<0.0001), and greater adherence to the DASH diet was associated with larger reductions in clinic SBP and DBP (P < 0.01). Only ethnicity predicted dietary adherence, with African Americans less adherent to the DASH diet compared with whites (4.68; 95% CI 4.34 to 5.03 vs 5.83; 95% CI 5.50 to 6.11; P<0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Greater adherence to the DASH diet was associated with larger BP reductions independent of weight loss. African Americans were less likely to be adherent to the DASH dietary eating plan compared with whites, suggesting that culturally sensitive dietary strategies might be needed to improve adherence to the DASH diet.Copyright © 2012 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

TI  - The effect of enhanced depression care on adherence to risk-reducing behaviors after acute coronary syndromes: findings from the COPES trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The presence of depression after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is associated with worse prognosis and lower adherence to risk-reducing behaviors. We reported earlier that an enhanced depression care intervention reduces depression symptoms and major adverse cardiac events. This study evaluates the impact of the depression intervention on health behavior and blood pressure control.
AB  - METHODS: Between 2005 and 2008, 157 patients who remained persistently depressed 3 months after ACS were randomized to a 6-month depression intervention (initial patient preference for problem-solving therapy and/or pharmacotherapy, followed by stepped care; 80 patients) or to usual care (77 patients). At randomization, and then 2, 4, and 6 months later, patients were asked if they (1) missed taking their aspirin; (2) followed a heart healthy diet; (3) exercised regularly; and (4) used tobacco products. Blood pressure was measured before randomization and 6 months later.
AB  - RESULTS: At the end of the intervention, there was no significant improvement in the percentage of intervention compared to control group patients who adhered to aspirin (+3% versus -1%, P = .23), followed a healthy diet (+10% versus +8%, P = .39), exercised regularly (+5% versus +4%, P = .65), abstained from tobacco (-3% versus -1%, P = .77), or had controlled blood pressure (+6% versus +16%, P = .26).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Despite improving depression, enhanced depression care after an ACS did not improve health behavior or blood pressure control compared to usual care. Research is needed to test whether adding an adherence intervention to enhanced depression care can improve adherence and cardiovascular prognosis in depressed patients post-ACS.Copyright © 2012 Mosby, Inc.

TI  - Outcomes of a home telehealth intervention for patients with diabetes and hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Home telehealth programs often focus on a single disease, yet many patients who need monitoring have multiple conditions. This study evaluated secondary outcomes from a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of home telehealth to improve outcomes of patients with co-morbid diabetes and hypertension.
AB  - SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A single-center randomized controlled clinical trial compared two remote monitoring intensity levels (low and high) and usual care in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension being treated in primary care. Secondary outcomes assessed were knowledge (diabetes, hypertension, medications), self-efficacy, adherence (diabetes, medications), and patient perceptions of the intervention mode.
AB  - RESULTS: Knowledge scores improved in the high-intensity intervention group participants, but upon further analysis, we found the intervention effect was not mediated by gain in knowledge. No significant differences were found across the groups in self-efficacy, adherence, or patient perceptions of the intervention mode.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Home telehealth can enhance detection of key clinical symptoms that occur between regular physician visits. While our intervention improved glycemic and blood pressure control, the mechanism of the effect for this improvement was not clear.

TI  - Implementation of shared decision making by physician training to optimise hypertension treatment. Study protocol of a cluster-RCT.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is one of the key factors causing cardiovascular diseases which make up the most frequent cause of death in industrialised nations. However about 60% of hypertensive patients in Germany treated with antihypertensives do not reach the recommended target blood pressure. The involvement of patients in medical decision making fulfils not only an ethical imperative but, furthermore, has the potential of higher treatment success. One concept to enhance the active role of patients is shared decision making. Until now there exists little information on the effects of shared decision making trainings for general practitioners on patient participation and on lowering blood pressure in hypertensive patients.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: In a cluster-randomised controlled trial 1800 patients receiving antihypertensives will be screened with 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in their general practitioners' practices. Only patients who have not reached their blood pressure target (approximately 1200) will remain in the study (T1 - T3). General practitioners of the intervention group will take part in a shared decision making-training after baseline assessment (T0). General practitioners of the control group will treat their patients as usual. Primary endpoints are change of systolic blood pressure and change of patients' perceived participation. Secondary endpoints are changes of diastolic blood pressure, knowledge, medical adherence and cardiovascular risk. Data analysis will be performed with mixed effects models.
AB  - DISCUSSION: The hypothesis underlying this study is that shared decision making, realised by a shared decision making training for general practitioners, activates patients, facilitates patients' empowerment and contributes to a better hypertension control. This study is the first one that tests this hypothesis with a (cluster-) randomised trial and a large sample size.

TI  - Adherence to blood pressure telemonitoring in a cluster-randomized clinical trial.
AB  - Hypertension is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and death worldwide. Advances in technology have added telemedicine as a tool for managing hypertension. The effectiveness of telemedicine depends on patients' ability to adhere to schedules of home monitoring and case management. Participants with uncontrolled hypertension in the intervention arm of a randomized trial who completed 6 months of follow-up were included in this analysis. They were asked to measure their blood pressure (BP) a minimum of 6 times per week using a telemonitor that transmitted the readings to their pharmacist case manager. Hypertensive patients in this study had high adherence to telemonitoring (73% took at least 6 BP readings per week) and phone visits (88% of expected visits were attended). In a multivariate analysis, older age, male sex, and some college education predicted better telemonitoring adherence. White non-Hispanic race/ethnicity predicted better adherence to phone visits with pharmacist case managers. Telemonitoring adherence and phone adherence were highly correlated; participants who did not send readings on schedule were more likely to skip at least one phone visit with their pharmacist case manager. The findings from this analysis indicate that hypertensive patients in this study were able to achieve and maintain high adherence to both the telemonitoring and the phone case management visits.Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Consultation training of nurses for cardiovascular prevention - a randomized study of 2 years duration.
AB  - The aim of this study was to increase patients' adherence to the treatment of hypertension through the consultation training of nurses. Thirty-three nurses were included in the study. In the intervention group (IG), 19 nurses took part in a 3-day residential training course on the Stages of Change model, Motivational Interviewing and guidelines for cardiovascular prevention, and recruited 153 patients. Sixteen nurses in the control group (CG) recruited 59 patients. A decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and total cholesterol was noticed in both groups over the 2 years. Heart rate (p =0.027), body mass index (p =0.019), weight (p =0.0001), waist (p =0.041), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (p =0.0001), the waist-hip ratio (p =0.024), and perceived stress (p =0.001) decreased to any great extent only in the IG. After 2 years, 52.6% of the patients in the IG (p =0.13) reached the target of <140/90 mmHg in blood pressure compared with 39.2% in the CG. For self-reported physical activity, there was a significant (p =0.021) difference between the groups. The beneficial effects of the consultation training on patients' weight parameters, physical activity, perceived stress and the proportion of patients who achieved blood pressure control emphasize consultation training and the use of behavioural models in motivating patients to adhere to treatment.

TI  - A multifactorial intervention to improve blood pressure control in co-existing diabetes and kidney disease: a feasibility randomized controlled trial.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to test the feasibility and impact of an intervention consisting of self-monitored blood pressure, medicine review, a Digital Versatile Disc, and motivational interviewing telephone calls to help people with diabetes and kidney disease improve their blood pressure control and adherence to prescribed medications.
AB  - BACKGROUND: People with co-existing diabetes, kidney disease and hypertension require multiple medications to manage their health. About 50% of people are non-adherent to their prescribed medications with non-adherence increasing in the presence of chronic conditions.
AB  - DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.
AB  - METHODS: Patients aged >18 years with diabetes, chronic kidney disease and systolic hypertension were recruited from nephrology and diabetes outpatients' clinics of an Australian metropolitan hospital between 2008-2009. Participants were randomly allocated on a 1:1 basis to one of two groups in a randomized controlled trial: the intervention delivered over 3 months (n = 39) and usual care (n = 41), with follow-up at 3, 6 and 9 months postintervention. People collecting data and assessing outcomes were blinded to group assignment.
AB  - RESULTS:   Seventy-five participants completed the study. The intervention was acceptable and feasible for this cohort. There were no statistically significant differences between groups, although the mean systolic blood pressure reduction in the intervention group (n = 36) was -6.9 mmHg 95% CI (-13.8, -0.02) at 9 months postintervention.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The study was feasible and statistically significant differences may be determinable in a larger sample to overcome the variability between groups, paying attention to recommendations for further research.
AB  - TRIAL REGISTRATION:   The trial was prospectively registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register (ACTRN12607000044426).Copyright © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Randomized controlled trial of clinical pharmacy management of patients with type 2 diabetes in an outpatient diabetes clinic in Jordan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glycemic goals (hemoglobin A1c < 7%) are often not achieved in patients with type 2 diabetes despite the availability of many effective treatments and the documented benefits of glycemic control in the reduction of long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications. Several studies have established the important positive effects of pharmacist-led management on achieving glycemic control and other clinical outcomes in patients with diabetes. Diabetes prevalence and mortality are increasing rapidly in Jordan. Nevertheless, clinical pharmacists in Jordan do not typically provide pharmaceutical care; instead, the principal responsibilities of pharmacists in Jordan are dispensing and marketing of medical products to physicians.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the primary clinical outcome of glycemic control (A1c) and secondary outcomes, including blood pressure, lipid values, self-reported medication adherence, and self-care activities for patients with type 2 diabetes in an outpatient diabetes clinic randomly assigned to either usual care or a pharmacist-led pharmaceutical care intervention program.
AB  - METHODS: Patients with type 2 diabetes attending an outpatient diabetes clinic of a large teaching hospital were recruited over a 4-month period from January through April 2011 and randomly assigned to intervention and usual care groups using the Minim software technique. The intervention group at baseline received face-to-face objective-directed education from a clinical pharmacist about type 2 diabetes, prescription medications, and necessary lifestyle changes, followed by 8 weekly telephone follow-up calls to discuss and review the prescribed treatment plan and to resolve any patient concerns. The primary outcome measure was glycemic control (A1c), and secondary measures included systolic and diastolic blood pressure, complete lipid profile (i.e., total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], serum triglycerides), and self-reported medication adherence (4-item Morisky Scale) and self-care activities (Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities questionnaire). Data were collected at baseline and at 6 months follow-up. Changes from baseline to follow-up were calculated for biomarker values, and between-group differences in the change amounts were tested using the t test for independent samples. A P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 77 of 85 patients (90.6%) randomly assigned to the intervention group and 79 of 86 patients (91.9%) assigned to usual care had baseline and 6-month follow-up values. Compared with baseline values, patients in the intervention group had a mean reduction of 0.8% in A1c versus a mean increase of 0.1% from baseline in the usual care group (P = 0.019). The intervention group compared with the usual care group had small but statistically significant improvements in the secondary measures of fasting blood glucose, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL-C, serum triglycerides, self-reported medication adherence, and self-care activities. Between-group differences in changes in the secondary measures of HDL-C and body mass index were not significant.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Patients with type 2 diabetes who received pharmacist-led pharmaceutical care in an outpatient diabetes clinic experienced reduction in A1c at 6 months compared with essentially no change in the usual care group. Six of 8 secondary biomarkers were improved in the intervention group compared with usual care.Copyright © 2012, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy. All rights reserved.

TI  - 'Diagnostic mode' improves adherence to the home blood pressure measurement schedule.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The accuracy of home blood pressure measurement (HBPM) depends on adherence to the measurement schedule. We investigated the number of deviations from the requested schedule using an HBPM device equipped with a diagnostic mode that only allows patients to take a fixed number of BP readings at preset times.
AB  - METHODS: We randomized patients to measure their BP as recommended by the European Society of Hypertension guideline in either the usual mode or the diagnostic mode.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 135 patients were included, mean age 54.4 +/- 13.6 years, 57 (42.2%) men, with a mean systolic BP of 147.0 +/- 18.4 mmHg and a mean diastolic BP of 88.0 +/- 10.3 mmHg. In 66 patients, BP was measured in the diagnostic mode, whereas in 69 patients BP was measured in the usual mode. In the diagnostic mode, 40% of patients showed full adherence to the measurement schedule, compared with 23% of patients in the usual mode (P = 0.02). Unscheduled measurements were performed by 55% of patients measuring BP in the usual mode and none in the diagnostic mode. The number of patients who omitted readings was similar in the diagnostic and the usual mode (P = 0.9). Compared with scheduled readings only, 12% of patients measuring BP in the usual mode fell into a different BP category, whereas reclassification did not occur in patients using the diagnostic mode (P = 0.03).
AB  - CONCLUSION: HBPM in the diagnostic mode almost doubled the number of patients with full adherence to the measurement schedule and eliminated the number of patients who were reclassified in a different BP category.

TI  - Catheter-based renal denervation for resistant hypertension: rationale and design of the SYMPLICITY HTN-3 Trial.
AB  - Hypertension represents a significant global public health concern, contributing to vascular and renal morbidity, cardiovascular mortality, and economic burden. The opportunity to influence clinical outcomes through hypertension management is therefore paramount. Despite adherence to multiple available medical therapies, a significant proportion of patients have persistent blood pressure elevation, a condition termed resistant hypertension. Recent recognition of the importance of the renal sympathetic and somatic nerves in modulating blood pressure and the development of a novel procedure that selectively removes these contributors to resistant hypertension represents an opportunity to provide clinically meaningful benefit across wide and varied patient populations. Early clinical evaluation with catheter-based, selective renal sympathetic denervation in patients with resistant hypertension has mechanistically correlated sympathetic efferent denervation with decreased renal norepinephrine spillover and renin activity, increased renal plasma flow, and has demonstrated clinically significant, sustained reductions in blood pressure. The SYMPLICITY HTN-3 Trial is a pivotal study designed as a prospective, randomized, masked procedure, single-blind trial evaluating the safety and effectiveness of catheter-based bilateral renal denervation for the treatment of uncontrolled hypertension despite compliance with at least 3 antihypertensive medications of different classes (at least one of which is a diuretic) at maximal tolerable doses. The primary effectiveness endpoint is measured as the change in office-based systolic blood pressure from baseline to 6 months. This manuscript describes the design and methodology of a regulatory trial of selective renal denervation for the treatment of hypertension among patients who have failed pharmacologic therapy.Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Compliance with cardiovascular drug prevention measures in a general population: the Multidisciplinary Intervention in Primary Care (IMAP) study.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate adherence to guideline-recommended drug therapies for primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention in a general Mediterranean population.
AB  - SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a random sample of 2270 individuals (18-80 years) assigned to a health centre in Malaga (Spain). The appropriate use was analysed of statins, antithrombotics, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB), based on the criteria of the European Guidelines on Cardiovascular Prevention and the European Society of Hypertension-European Society of Cardiology.
AB  - RESULTS: The prescription rate of statins, antithrombotics, beta-blockers, and ACEI/ARB was 7.8%, 5.1%, 3.3%, and 11%, respectively. The prescription of these drugs was inappropriate in 36.2%, 22.4%, 64.5%, and 0%, respectively. Overtreatment was more frequent in subjects with greater comorbidity or > 2 vascular risk factors (p < 0.001). The percentage of individuals with prescription criteria but who did not receive the treatment was 19.5%, 4.7%, 2%, and 9.3%, respectively, increasing significantly with age, Charlson index, and the presence of > 2 risk factors (p < 0.001). Only 11% of patients in secondary prevention received combination therapy with statins, antithrombotics, and ACEI/ARB. Patients with ischaemic heart disease, as compared to non-coronary vascular patients, more frequently received statins (56.1% vs. 25.6%; p = 0.0001) and antithrombotic drugs (66.7% vs. 56.4%; p = 0.02).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: We detected a low adherence to existing pharmacological guidelines for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. A priority is to establish appropriate training and dissemination of cardiovascular prevention guidelines in the field of primary care.

TI  - Improving blood pressure control in end stage renal disease through a supportive educative nursing intervention.
AB  - Hypertension in patients on hemodialysis (HD) contributes significantly to their morbidity and mortality. This study examined whether a supportive nursing intervention incorporating monitoring, goal setting, and reinforcement can improve blood pressure (BP) control in a chronic HD population. A randomized controlled design was used and 118 participants were recruited from six HD units in the Detroit metro area. The intervention consisted of (1) BP education sessions; (2) a 12-week intervention, including monitoring, goal setting, and reinforcement; and (3) a 30-day post-intervention follow-up period. Participants in the treatment were asked to monitor their BP, sodium, and fluid intake weekly for 12 weeks in weekly logs. BP, fluid and sodium logs were reviewed weekly with the researcher to determine if goals were met or not met. Reinforcement was given for goals met and problem solving offered when goals were not met. The control group received standard care. Both systolic and diastolic BPs were significantly decreased in the treatment group.

TI  - 'Decision support system (DSS) for prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among hypertensive (HTN) patients in Andhra Pradesh, India'--a cluster randomised community intervention trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Very few studies having decision support systems as an intervention report on patient outcomes for cardiovascular disease in the Western world. The potential role of decision support system for the management of blood pressure among Indian hypertensives remains unclear. We propose a cluster randomised trial that aims to test the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of DSS among Indian hypertensive patients.
AB  - METHODS: The trial design is a cluster randomised community intervention trial, in which the participants would be adult male and female hypertensive patients, in the age group of 35 to 64 years, reporting to the Primary Health Care centres of Mahabubnagar district, Andhra Pradesh, India. The objective of the study is to test the effectiveness and compare the cost effectiveness and cost utility among hypertensive subjects randomized to receive either decision support system or a chart based algorithmic support system in urban and rural areas of a district in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India (baseline versus 12 months follow up). The primary outcome would be a comparison of the systolic blood pressure at 0 and 12 months among hypertensive patients randomized to receive the decision support system or the chart based algorithmic support system. Computer generated randomisation and an investigator and analyser blinded method would be followed. 1600 participants; 800 to each arm; each arm having eight clusters of hundred participants each have been recruited between 01 August 2011 - 01 March 2012. A twelve month follow up will be completed by March 2013 and results are expected by April 2013.
AB  - DISCUSSION: This cluster randomized community intervention trial on DSS will enable policy makers to find out the effectiveness, cost effectiveness and cost utility of decision support system for management of blood pressure among hypertensive patients in India. Most of the previous studies on decision support system have focused on physician performance, adherence and on preventive care reminders. The uniqueness of the proposed study lies in finding out the effectiveness of a decision support system on patient related outcomes.

TI  - A moderate-sodium DASH-type diet improves mood in postmenopausal women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We compared the effect on mood of a moderate sodium Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension-type diet, which included lean red meat (vitality diet [VD]), with a healthy diet (HD; decreased fat and increased wholegrain breads and cereal).
AB  - METHODS: In a randomized, parallel intervention study, postmenopausal women were assigned to the VD or HD for 14 wk. Mood was measured every 2 wk by the Profile of Mood States. Dietary adherence was assessed using 24-h urine collections. Data were analyzed using one-way between-groups multivariate analysis of variance and correlations.
AB  - RESULTS: Forty-six subjects completed the VD and 49 completed the HD. The two groups showed an improvement in anger, confusion, depression, fatigue, tension, vigor, and the Profile of Mood States global score over the length of the intervention (P < 0.01 for time), but there was a significant diet group by time effect for anger (P < 0.05), such that anger improved more in the VD compared with the HD group. For the two groups combined, urinary sodium excretion was associated with the Profile of Mood States global score, such that a low sodium intake was associated with a better mood (r = 0.267, P < 0.05). In addition, red meat consumption (a component of the VD) was associated with a decrease in depression (r = -0.21, P < 0.05) and an increase in fruit consumption was associated with a decrease in confusion (r = -0.26, P < 0.05).
AB  - CONCLUSION: In addition to the health benefits of a moderate-sodium Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet on blood pressure and bone health, this diet had a positive effect on improving mood in postmenopausal women.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the experience of youth participating in a 2-6 month run-in period in preparation for randomization into TODAY.
AB  - SUBJECTS: An ethnically diverse sample of 927 youth, 65.4% females, aged 13.7 +/- 2.0 yr old, with type 2 diabetes for a median of 2 months (0.7-7.8 months, 25th-75th percentiles).
AB  - METHODS: A run-in period was conducted to achieve HbA1c <8% with metformin monotherapy and diabetes education, and to evaluate adherence to pill taking, visit attendance, and other procedures.
AB  - RESULTS: At entry, mean body mass index (BMI) and z-BMI were 35.6 +/- 7.7 and 2.3 +/- 0.4, respectively, mean HbA1c was 7.7 +/- 2.2%, only 42.5% were on a hypoglycemic treatment, and 35.6% had HbA1c >8%. Comorbid conditions were common; 18.8% had hypertension, 24.2% had elevated cholesterol, and 6.5% had abnormal liver enzymes. After a median 71 d of run-in, 90.9% had HbA1c <8%, 77.9% had HbA1c <7%, and 46.4% had HbA1c <6%. Of the 772 youth achieving the target HbA1c <8%, 704 (91.2%) were randomized; non-adherence to metformin treatment was the main cause for non-randomization. Youth proceeding to randomization decreased weight by 0.68kg and HbA1c by 1.45% compared to a weight gain of 0.71kg and HbA1c decrease of 0.74% in the non-randomized youth (p = 0.01 in both cases). However, change in z-BMI was not significantly different between the two groups.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Most youth with recent onset type 2 diabetes can achieve target HbA1c <8.0% with short-term metformin monotherapy and standard diabetes education (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00081328).Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

TI  - Losartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination vs. high-dose losartan in patients with morning hypertension--a prospective, randomized, open-labeled, parallel-group, multicenter trial.
AB  - The treatment of morning hypertension has not been established. We compared the efficacy and safety of a losartan/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) combination and high-dose losartan in patients with morning hypertension. A prospective, randomized, open-labeled, parallel-group, multicenter trial enrolled 216 treated outpatients with morning hypertension evaluated by home blood pressure (BP) self-measurement. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a combination therapy of 50mg losartan and 12.5mg HCTZ (n=109) or a high-dose therapy with 100mg losartan (n=107), each of which were administered once every morning. Primary efficacy end points were morning systolic BP (SBP) level and target BP achievement rate after 3 months of treatment. At baseline, BP levels were similar between the two therapy groups. Morning SBP was reduced from 150.3+/-10.1 to 131.5+/-11.5mmHg by combination therapy (P<0.001) and from 151.0+/-9.3 to 142.5+/-13.6mmHg by high-dose therapy (P<0.001). The morning SBP reduction was greater in the combination therapy group than in the high-dose therapy group (P<0.001). Combination therapy decreased evening SBP from 141.6+/-13.3 to 125.3+/-13.1mmHg (P<0.001), and high-dose therapy decreased evening SBP from 138.9+/-9.9 to 131.4+/-13.2mmHg (P<0.01). Although both therapies improved target BP achievement rates in the morning and evening (P<0.001 for both), combination therapy increased the achievement rates more than high-dose therapy (P<0.001 and P<0.05, respectively). In clinic measurements, combination therapy was superior to high-dose therapy in reducing SBP and improving the achievement rate (P<0.001 and P<0.01, respectively). Combination therapy decreased urine albumin excretion (P<0.05) whereas high-dose therapy reduced serum uric acid. Both therapies indicated strong adherence and few adverse effects (P<0.001). In conclusion, losartan/HCTZ combination therapy was more effective for controlling morning hypertension and reducing urine albumin than high-dose losartan.

TI  - Does a combination pill of antihypertensive drugs improve medication adherence in Japanese? A randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to achieve target blood pressure levels to prevent cardiovascular disease, combination therapy of antihypertensive drugs is often required, although it is thought that requiring a patient to take many different pills would reduce adherence to the medication regimen. Whether antihypertensive treatment with a single pill combining antihypertensive drugs would improve medication adherence and blood pressure control was investigated.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 207 hypertensive subjects were randomly assigned to a combination pill group (losartan 50mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg; n=103) or a control group (an angiotensin receptor blocker and a thiazide diuretic; n=104). Medication adherence was evaluated by pill counts at 1, 3, and 6 months after randomization. The mean adherence rates over 6 months were not different between the 2 groups: 98% in the combination pill group and 98% in the control group. Moreover, the 2 groups included similar numbers of subjects with relatively poor adherence rates (<90%) in each treatment period. The mean blood pressures over the 6-month treatment period were not different between the groups: 131/75 mmHg in the combination pill group and 130/75 mmHg in the control group (P=0.84/0.96).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: There were no appreciable effects of the combination pill of antihypertensive drugs on medication adherence or blood pressure control in Japanese patients over a 6-month period.

TI  - Predictors of antihypertensive medication adherence in two urban health-care systems.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most studies on patient-related predictors of adherence used self-reported measures or pharmacy databases to measure adherence. We identified predictors of antihypertensive medication adherence measured by Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS), the gold standard for adherence assessment, in uncontrolled, predominantly African-American (AA) hypertensives from large urban public and private primary care clinics.
AB  - METHODS: As part of the baseline data collection of a cluster-randomized trial for hypertension control, we measured adherence in a random sample of 124 participants using MEMS caps. We also included the data of 52 patients in intervention clinics who subsequently completed MEMS monitoring on referral from their provider. Participants were classified as adherent if they took > 80% of all prescribed doses. Multivariate logistic regression was used to predict adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 176 patients monitored, 61 (34.6%) took <80% of prescribed doses. AA ethnicity (odds ratio (OR) AA vs. Hispanic = 0.36; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15-0.86), female sex (OR = 0.38; 95% CI 0.15-0.91), and public clinics as source of care (OR public clinics vs. private clinics = 0.45; 95% CI 0.20-0.97) were independently associated with lower adherence. Higher adherence was seen in patients monitored by clinician order in the intervention clinics (OR intervention sample vs. random baseline sample = 2.15; 95% CI 0.96-4.81) and diabetic patients (OR = 2.05; 95% CI 1.01-4.15). All analyses were adjusted for education, employment status, and other potentially confounding factors.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: AA ethnicity, female gender and attending a publicly funded primary care clinic were associated with lower adherence. Whether targeting these groups for special interventions would improve overall adherence needs further study.

TI  - Improving blood pressure control through a clinical pharmacist outreach program in patients with diabetes mellitus in 2 high-performing health systems: the adherence and intensification of medications cluster randomized, controlled pragmatic trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Even in high-performing health systems, some patients with diabetes mellitus have poor blood pressure (BP) control because of poor medication adherence and lack of medication intensification. We examined whether the Adherence and Intensification of Medications intervention, a pharmacist-led intervention combining elements found in efficacy studies to lower BP, improved BP among patients with diabetes mellitus with persistent hypertension and poor refill adherence or insufficient medication intensification in 2 high-performing health systems.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a prospective, multisite cluster randomized pragmatic trial with randomization of 16 primary care teams at 5 medical centers (3 Veterans Affairs and 2 Kaiser Permanente) to the Adherence and Intensification of Medications intervention or usual care. The primary outcome was relative change in systolic BP (SBP), comparing 1797 intervention with 2303 control team patients, from 6 months preceding to 6 months after the 14-month intervention period. We examined shorter-term changes in SBP as a secondary outcome. The mean SBP decrease from 6 months before to 6 months after the intervention period was =9 mm Hg in both arms. Mean SBPs of eligible intervention patients were 2.4 mm Hg lower (95% CI: -3.4 to -1.5; P<0.001) immediately after the intervention than those achieved by control patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The Adherence and Intensification of Medications program more rapidly lowered SBPs among intervention patients, but usual-care patients achieved equally low SBP levels by 6 months after the intervention period. These findings show the importance of evaluating in different real-life clinical settings programs found in efficacy trials to be effective before urging their widespread adoption in all settings.

TI  - Blood pressure monitoring technique impacts hypertension treatment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2005 the American Heart Association (AHA) released updated recommendations for blood pressure (BP) monitoring in order to ensure accurate BP measurements.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if current methods of BP assessment in an ambulatory clinic result in significantly different BP measurements than those obtained by following the AHA recommendations and if these BP differences impact treatment decisions.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN: Randomized prospective analysis.
AB  - SETTING: University of New Mexico Hospital Adult Internal Medicine clinic.
AB  - PATIENTS: Forty adults with hypertension
AB  - METHODS: Patient BPs were measured using both the traditional triage method and the AHA-recommended method in cross-over fashion in random order. Two complete medical profile summaries were then constructed for each patient: one for each BP measurement obtained by each technique. These profiles were then reviewed by a panel of providers who provided hypothetical hypertension treatment recommendations.
AB  - RESULTS: Individual BP results varied greatly between the two methods. SBP readings differed by >5 mmHg in either direction for 68% of patients while 78% of patient's DBP readings differed by >2 mmHg in either direction. Overall, 93% of patients had a BP difference of either >5 mmHg systolic or >2 mmHg diastolic. Five patients were determined to be at goal with the triage method, but were higher than their goal BP with the AHA method Significant differences were also seen in treatment recommendations for a given patient based on the differences seen between the two obtained BP readings. The number of patients with treatment variations between their two profiles ranged from 13% to 23% depending on the reviewing provider (p<0.01 for all providers).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Inaccurate BP assessment is common and may impact hypertension treatment decisions.

TI  - Health coaching to improve hypertension treatment in a low-income, minority population.
AB  - PURPOSE: Poor blood pressure control is common in the United States. We conducted a study to determine whether health coaching with home titration of antihypertensive medications can improve blood pressure control compared with health coaching alone in a low-income, predominantly minority population.
AB  - METHODS: We randomized 237 patients with poorly controlled hypertension at a primary care clinic to receive either home blood pressure monitoring, weekly health coaching, and home titration of blood pressure medications if blood pressures were elevated (n = 129) vs home blood pressure monitoring and health coaching but no home titration (n = 108). The primary outcome was change in systolic blood pressure from baseline to 6 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Both the home-titration arm and the no-home-titration arm had a reduction in systolic blood pressure, with no significant difference between them. When both arms were combined and analyzed as a before-after study, there was a mean decrease in systolic blood pressure of 21.8 mm Hg (P <.001) as well as a decrease in the number of primary care visits from 3.5 in the 6 months before the study to 2.6 during the 6-month study period (P <.001) and 2.4 in the 6 months after the study (P <.001). The more coaching encounters patients had, the greater their reduction in blood pressure.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Blood pressure control in a low-income, minority population can be improved by teaching patients to monitor their blood pressure at home and having nonprofessional health coaches assist patients, in particular, by counseling them on medication adherence. The improved blood pressure control can be achieved while reducing the time spent by physicians.

TI  - Predictors of lowering SBP to assigned targets at 12 months in the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lowering blood pressure for secondary stroke prevention remains a challenge. These analyses were conducted to identify factors predicting achievement of SBP targets in the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3) study.
AB  - METHODS: SPS3 is a randomized trial assigning patients with lacunar stroke to two targets of SBP control (130-149 mmHg or <130 mmHg). Logistic regression models were used to identify patient and SPS3 site characteristics predictive of lowering SBP to target at the 12-month study visit.
AB  - RESULTS: Of those above target at baseline (n = 1041), 69% were within their assigned target at 12 months. In the model with baseline characteristics only, those receiving treatment for hypertension at baseline were 68% less likely to achieve target [odds ratio (OR) = 0.32; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.17-0.60], whereas those of Hispanic ethnicity were 1.49 times more likely (95% CI = 1.09-2.03) to achieve SBP target. When clinical site characteristics were added to the model, only treated hypertension at baseline remained significant. In addition, management at a larger site (OR = 1.51; 95% CI = 1.03-2.20), SBP in target at 6 months (OR = 2.39; 95% CI = 1.79-3.19), and medication adherence (OR = 2.73; 95% CI = 1.51-4.95) were positively associated with achieving target SBP. Missed appointments (OR = 0.55; 95% CI = 0.41-0.73) were negatively associated with lowering SBP to target at 12 months.
AB  - CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that it is feasible to achieve targets of SBP control in this multiethnic stroke cohort across multiple sites and countries. The results highlight the important variables reflecting clinical site management.

TI  - Persistence and adherence to antihypertensive treatment in relation to initial prescription: diuretics versus other classes of antihypertensive drugs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of thiazide diuretics in the treatment of hypertension is widely considered as a first-line treatment, given the efficacy and low cost of this class of drugs. This indication is not unanimous, because thiazides can cause metabolic alterations, and other side effects that reduce compliance and persistence on treatment.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In a multicentre, open-label randomized study we compared adherence and persistence to therapy of chlortalidone versus other treatments, as a first-line antihypertensive therapy.
AB  - METHODS: Ninety-two general practitioners (GPs) recruited 2409 hypertensive patients with indication to antihypertensive therapy, who were randomized in two arms to start treatment with chlortalidone (12.5-25 mg daily) or any other single medications (excluding thiazides). The patients have been followed for at least 2 years.
AB  - RESULT: Patients receiving diuretic therapy as first-line antihypertensive treatment, modified antihypertensive treatment regimen more often than the others (79.1 versus 43.9%; chi (2)< 0.0001). Patients starting with diuretics received greater number of drugs, compared to patients starting with different antihypertensive therapy (1.55 versus 1.4 antihypertensive drugs; P < 0.0001), but achieved the same blood pressure (BP) control during the follow-up. No differences were observed in persistence and adherence to treatment between the two groups.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that the recommendation to start antihypertensive therapy with diuretics, when no compelling indications are present, is not supported by the evidence that this strategy produces more rapid and better control of BP.

TI  - The effect of patient-provider communication on medication adherence in hypertensive black patients: does race concordance matter?.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite evidence of a positive effect of collaborative patient-provider communication on patient outcomes, our understanding of this relationship is unclear.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to determine whether racial composition of the relationship modified the association between ratings of provider communication and medication adherence.
AB  - METHODS: Effect modification of the communication-adherence association, by racial composition of the relationship, was evaluated using general linear mixed models while adjusting for selected covariates.
AB  - RESULTS: Three hundred ninety patients were in race-concordant (black patient, black provider) relationships, while 207 were in race-discordant (black patient, white provider) relationships. The communication-adherence association was significantly modified in race-discordant relationships (p = 0.04). Communication rated as more collaborative in race-discordant relationships was associated with better adherence, while communication rated as less collaborative was associated with poor adherence. There was no significant association between adherence and communication in race-concordant relationships (p = 0.24).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Collaborative patient-provider communication may play an influential role in black patients' adherence behaviors when receiving care from white providers.

TI  - Reducing clinical inertia in hypertension treatment: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial.
AB  - Clinical inertia is a major contributor to poor blood pressure (BP) control. The authors tested the effectiveness of an intervention targeting physician, patient, and office system factors with regard to outcomes of clinical inertia and BP control. A total of 591 adult primary care patients with elevated BP (mean systolic BP > 140 mm Hg or mean diastolic BP > 90 mm Hg) were randomized to intervention or usual care. An outreach coordinator raised patient and provider awareness of unmet BP goals, arranged BP-focused primary care clinic visits, and furnished providers with treatment decision support. The intervention reduced clinical inertia (-29% vs -11%, P=.001). Nonetheless, change in BP did not differ between intervention and usual care (-10.1/-4.1 mm Hg vs -9.1/-4.5 mm Hg, P=.50 and 0.71 for systolic and diastolic BP, respectively). Future primary care-focused interventions might benefit from the use of specific medication titration protocols, treatment adherence support, and more sustained patient follow-up visits.Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - A healthy dietary pattern at midlife is associated with subsequent cognitive performance.
AB  - Few studies have investigated the long-term impact of overall dietary patterns (DP) on cognition. We evaluated the association between empirically derived DP in midlife and cognitive performance 13 y later. Dietary data were based on 24-h dietary records obtained from a subsample of the Supplementation en Vitamines et Mineraux Antioxydant Study. Cognitive performance was assessed via a battery of neuropsychological tests that included verbal fluency, the RI-48 cued recall test, the trail-making test, and forward and backward digit span. Three composite variables, for global cognitive function, verbal memory, and executive functioning, were built. The multivariate analyses were adjusted for baseline characteristics (age, gender, intervention group, education, alcohol and energy intake, number of dietary records, physical activity, BMI, tobacco use, self-reported memory troubles, diabetes, hypertension, and, for women, menopausal status and hormone therapy use), follow-up time, history of cardiovascular disease, and depressive symptoms. Adjusted means +/- SEM of composite variables across quartiles (Q4 vs. Q1) of DP were estimated using ANCOVA. A healthy and a traditional DP were identified. In the multivariate model, the healthy pattern was associated with better global cognitive function (50.1 +/- 0.7 vs. 48.9 +/- 0.7; P-trend = 0.001) and verbal memory (49.7 +/- 0.4 vs. 48.7 +/- 0.4; P-trend = 0.01). These relationships were stronger in participants scoring below the gender-specific median values for energy intake (<2490 kcal for men and <1810 for women) than in those scoring at or above those values. Adherence to a healthy DP in middle life may help preserve global cognitive function, especially verbal memory, when total energy intake is regulated.

TI  - Sustained decrease in blood pressure following missed doses of aliskiren or telmisartan: the ASSERTIVE double-blind, randomized study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The AliSkiren Study of profound antihypERtensive efficacy in hyperTensIVE patients (ASSERTIVE) study was designed to assess the sustained blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect of aliskiren vs. telmisartan after a 7-day treatment withdrawal in patients with hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: Patients were randomized to once-daily aliskiren 150  mg (N = 414) or telmisartan 40  mg (N = 408). After 2 weeks, all patients were uptitrated to double the initial dose for 10 weeks; subsequently, all patients were treated with placebo to simulate a 7-day treatment withdrawal.
AB  - RESULTS: At the end of active treatment (EoA), similar decreases in mean ambulatory BP were observed with aliskiren and telmisartan. From EoA to day 7 of treatment withdrawal (end of withdrawal, EoW), the least squares mean increase in 24-h mean ambulatory SBP was smaller for aliskiren (2.7 mmHg) vs. telmisartan (6.5  mmHg). Between-treatment difference was significant in favour of aliskiren (-3.8  mmHg; P < 0.0001). Similar effects were observed for the increase in 24-h mean ambulatory DBP after EoW (-2.1 mmHg; P < 0.0001). Mean sitting SBP and DBP were also significantly lower with aliskiren than telmisartan after EoW with SBP (2.0  mmHg) and DBP (1.1  mmHg) differences in favour of aliskiren, already evident on day 2 after a single 'missed dose'.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Aliskiren showed a greater and more sustained BP-lowering effect than telmisartan during a 7-day treatment withdrawal. Aliskiren may provide sustained BP lowering during 1 day or more missed dose.

TI  - Adherence to placebo and mortality in the Beta Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials have reported lower mortality among patients who adhere to placebo compared with those who do not. We explored this phenomenon by reanalyzing data from the placebo arm of the Beta Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of bucindolol and mortality.
AB  - AIMS: Our primary aim was to measure and explain the association between adherence to placebo and total mortality among the placebo-allocated participants in the BEST trial. Secondary aims included assessment of the association between placebo adherence and cause-specific mortality.
AB  - METHODS: Participants with "higher placebo adherence" were defined as having taken at least 75% of their placebo study medication over the entire course of each individual's participation in the study, while those with "lower placebo adherence" took <75%. Primary outcome was in-study all-cause mortality. To account for confounding, we adjusted for all available modifiable, non-modifiable and psychosocial variables.
AB  - RESULTS: Adherent participants had a significantly lower total mortality compared to less-adherent participants (HR=0.61, 95% Confidence Interval: 0.46-0.82). Adjusting for available confounders did not change the magnitude or significance of the estimates. When considering cause-specific mortality, CVD and pump failure showed similar associations.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Analyses of the BEST trial data support a strong association between adherence to placebo study medication and total mortality. While probably not due to publication bias or simple confounding by healthy lifestyle factors, the underlying explanation for the association remains a mystery. Prospective examination of this association is necessary to better understand the underlying mechanism of this observation.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effect of a physician uncertainty reduction intervention on blood pressure in uncontrolled hypertensives--a cluster randomized trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical inertia, provider failure to appropriately intensify treatment, is a major contributor to uncontrolled blood pressure (BP). Some clinical inertia may result from physician uncertainty over the patient's usual BP, adherence, or value of continuing efforts to control BP through lifestyle changes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that providing physicians with uncertainty reduction tools, including 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, electronic bottle cap monitoring, and lifestyle assessment and counseling, will lead to improved BP control.
AB  - DESIGN: Cluster randomized trial with five intervention clinics (IC) and five usual care clinics (UCC).
AB  - SETTING: Six public and 4 private primary care clinics.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: A total of 665 patients (63 percent African American) with uncontrolled hypertension (BP >140 mmHg/90 mmHg or >130/80 mmHg if diabetic).
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: An order form for uncertainty reduction tools was placed in the IC participants' charts before each visit and results fed back to the provider.
AB  - OUTCOME MEASURES: Percent with controlled BP at last visit. Secondary outcome was BP changes from baseline.
AB  - RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 24 months. IC physicians intensified treatment in 81% of IC patients compared to 67% in UCC (p<0.001); 35.0% of IC patients and 31.9% of UCC patients achieved control at the last recorded visit (p>0.05). Multi-level mixed effects longitudinal regression modeling of SBP and DBP indicated a significant, non-linear slope difference favoring IC (p (time x group interaction)=0.048 for SBP and p=0.001 for DBP). The model-predicted difference attributable to intervention was -2.8 mmHg for both SBP and DBP by month 24, and -6.5 mmHg for both SBP and DBP by month 36.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The uncertainty reduction intervention did not achieve the pre-specified dichotomous outcome, but led to lower measured BP in IC patients.

TI  - Delegating responsibility from clinicians to nonprofessional personnel: the example of hypertension control.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Involving nonclinician personnel in the treatment of hypertension may provide a solution to improve blood pressure control; however, this team-based approach cannot be implemented without first determining clinicians' willingness to delegate patient care to nonclinician team members. This study explores clinicians' perspectives on working with nonclinicians trained as "health coaches" to address medication adherence and lack of medication intensification among low-income patients with uncontrolled hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: We used a qualitative research approach to determine clinicians' opinions on the Treat-to-Target study, an intervention to improve blood pressure control. We conducted focus groups with clinicians who practice family medicine in a safety net clinic. Transcripts were analyzed using thematic content analysis.
AB  - RESULTS: Seven overarching themes emerged: (1) Clinicians support the delegation of functions to health coaches; (2) clinicians like the high frequency of coach-patient interactions; (3) clinicians feel that health coaching assists medication adherence; (4) clinicians have varying views on home titration; (5) coach-clinician communication is necessary for successful delegation; (6) coaching helps clinicians understand their patients' barriers to hypertension control; and (7) clinicians would like health coaching to continue on a permanent basis.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Clinicians appreciate the presence of nonclinicians on the primary care team. In the coming era of primary care clinician shortage, clinicians can be supportive of nonprofessional team members assisting with the care of patients with hypertension.

TI  - Self measurement of blood pressure for control of blood pressure levels and adherence to treatment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The measurement of blood pressure (BP) by the patient himself without strict protocols, adequate training, and validated equipment at their own household is defined as self measured blood pressure (SMBP).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the interference of the SMBP in treatment adherence and blood pressure control.
AB  - METHODS: The study included 57 patients, 38 in the study group (SG) and 19 in the control group (CG). These patients were followed for 12 months and assessed at randomization (V1) as well as in the sixth (V2) and the twelfth month (V3). Compare the mean blood pressure by casual measurement, by SMBP and by ambulatory monitoring of blood pressure (AMBP), laboratory tests and the answers to the questionnaire on lifestyle. The instruments used were: OMRON HEM 714, for SMBP; OMRON 705 CP, for the casual measurement, and Monitor SPACELABS 9002 for the AMBP.
AB  - RESULTS: The average age was 62.05 +/- 10.78 in the SG and 55.42 +/- 11.87 in the CG (p = 0.03). The values of systolic blood pressure (SBP) by casual measurement in the SG and CG were: 140.01 +/- 16.73 mmHg and 141.79 +/- 23.21 mmHg in V1 (p = 0.72), 135.49 +/- 12.73 mmHg and 145.69 +/- 19.31 mmHg in V2 (p = 0.02), 131.64 +/- 19.28 mmHg and 134.88 +/- 23.21 mmHg at V3 (p = 0.59). The values of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were: 84.13 +/- 10.71 mmHg and 86.29 +/- 10.35 mmHg in V1 (p = 0.47), 81.69 +/- 10.88 mmHg and 89.61 V2 +/- 11.58 mmHg (p = 0.02), 80.31 +/- 11.83 mmHg and 86 +/- 13.38 mmHg in V3 (p = 0.12).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Patients in the SG had adherence to non-pharmacological treatment similar to the CG, but they had greater adherence to drug treatment and used fewer antihypertensive drugs. There was no difference between groups when comparing the metabolic profile and renal function.

TI  - Increasing physical activity in patients with asthma through positive affect and self-affirmation: a randomized trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with asthma engage in less physical activity than peers without asthma. Protocols are needed to prudently increase physical activity in asthma patients. We evaluated whether an educational intervention enhanced with positive-affect induction and self-affirmation was more effective than the educational protocol alone in increasing physical activity in asthma patients.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial in New York City from September 28, 2004, through July 5, 2007; of 258 asthma patients, 252 completed the trial. At enrollment, control subjects completed a survey measuring energy expenditure, made a contract to increase physical activity, received a pedometer and an asthma workbook, and then underwent bimonthly follow-up telephone calls. Intervention patients received this protocol plus small gifts and instructions in fostering positive affect and self-affirmation. The main outcome was the within-patient change in energy expenditure in kilocalories per week from enrollment to 12 months with an intent-to-treat analysis.
AB  - RESULTS: Mean (SD) energy expenditure at enrollment was 1767 (1686) kcal/wk among controls and 1860 (1633) kcal/wk among intervention patients (P = .65) and increased by 415 (95% CI, 76-754; P = .02) and 398 (95% CI, 145-652; P = .002) kcal/wk, respectively, with no difference between groups (P = .94). For both groups, energy expenditure was sustained through 12 months. No adverse events were attributed to the trial. In multivariate analysis, increased energy expenditure was associated with less social support, decreased depressive symptoms, more follow-up calls, use of the pedometer, fulfillment of the contract, and the intervention among patients who required urgent asthma care (all P < .10, 2-sided test).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A multiple-component protocol was effective in increasing physical activity in asthma patients, but an intervention to increase positive affect and self-affirmation was not effective within this protocol. The intervention may have had some benefit, however, in the subgroup of patients who required urgent asthma care during the trial. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00195117.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of positive-affect intervention and medication adherence in hypertensive African Americans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor adherence explains poor blood pressure (BP) control; however African Americans suffer worse hypertension-related outcomes.
AB  - METHODS: This randomized controlled trial evaluated whether a patient education intervention enhanced with positive-affect induction and self-affirmation (PA) was more effective than patient education (PE) alone in improving medication adherence and BP reduction among 256 hypertensive African Americans followed up in 2 primary care practices. Patients in both groups received a culturally tailored hypertension self-management workbook, a behavioral contract, and bimonthly telephone calls designed to help them overcome barriers to medication adherence. Also, patients in the PA group received small gifts and bimonthly telephone calls to help them incorporate positive thoughts into their daily routine and foster self-affirmation. The main outcome measures were medication adherence (assessed with electronic pill monitors) and within-patient change in BP from baseline to 12 months.
AB  - RESULTS: The baseline characteristics were similar in both groups: the mean BP was 137/82 mm Hg; 36% of the patients had diabetes; 11% had stroke; and 3% had chronic kidney disease. Based on the intention-to-treat principle, medication adherence at 12 months was higher in the PA group than in the PE group (42% vs 36%, respectively; P =.049). The within-group reduction in systolic BP (2.14 mm Hg vs 2.18 mm Hg; P = .98) and diastolic BP (-1.59 mm Hg vs -0.78 mm Hg; P = .45) for the PA group and PE group, respectively, was not significant.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A PE intervention enhanced with PA led to significantly higher medication adherence compared with PE alone in hypertensive African Americans. Future studies should assess the cost-effectiveness of integrating such interventions into primary care. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00227175.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of positive-affect induction to promote physical activity after percutaneous coronary intervention.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Within 1 year after percutaneous coronary intervention, more than 20% of patients experience new adverse events. Physical activity confers a 25% reduction in mortality; however, physical activity is widely underused. Thus, there is a need for more powerful behavioral interventions to promote physical activity. Our objective was to motivate patients to achieve an increase in expenditure of 336 kcal/wk or more at 12 months as assessed by the Paffenbarger Physical Activity and Exercise Index.
AB  - METHODS: Two hundred forty-two patients were recruited immediately after percutaneous coronary intervention between October 2004 and October 2006. Patients were randomized to 1 of 2 groups. The patient education (PE) control group (n = 118) (1) received an educational workbook, (2) received a pedometer, and (3) set a behavioral contract for a physical activity goal. The positive-affect/self-affirmation (PA) intervention group (n = 124) received the 3 PE control components plus (1) a PA workbook chapter, (2) bimonthly induction of PA by telephone, and (3) small mailed gifts. All patients were contacted with standardized bimonthly telephone follow-up for 12 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Attrition was 4.5%, and 2.1% of patients died. Significantly more patients in the PA intervention group increased expenditure by 336 kcal/wk or more at 12 months, our main outcome, compared with the PE control group (54.9% vs 37.4%, P = .007). The PA intervention patients were 1.7 times more likely to reach the goal of a 336-kcal/wk or more increase by 12 months, controlling for demographic and psychosocial measures. In multivariate analysis, the PA intervention patients had nearly double the improvement in kilocalories per week at 12 months compared with the PE control patients (602 vs 328, P = .03).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Patients who receive PA intervention after percutaneous coronary intervention are able to achieve a sustained and clinically significant increase in physical activity by 12 months. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00248846.

TI  - [Prevention of therapeutic inertia in the treatment of arterial hypertension by using a program of home blood pressure monitoring]. [Spanish]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a program of home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) on therapeutic Inertia (TI) in mild-to-moderate hypertension (AHT).
AB  - DESIGN: Controlled, randomised clinical trial.
AB  - SETTING: Forty six clinics in 35 primary care centres. Spain.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: A total of 232 patients with uncontrolled hypertension were included.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Two groups with 116 patients were formed: 1) Control group (CG): standard health intervention; 2) Intervention group (IG): patients who were included in the HBPM program.
AB  - MAIN MEASUREMENTS: TI was calculated by the ratio: Number of patients whose pharmacological treatment was not changed in each visit/Number of patients with an average BP 140mmHg and/or 90mmHg in the general population or 130 and/or 90 mmHg in diabetics. The mean BPs and the percentage of controlled patients were calculated. The mean number of people that required an intervention in order to avoid TI was calculated (NI).
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 209 patients completed the study, with TI in 35.64% (95% CI=29.85%-41.43%) of the sample, and in 71.63% (95% CI=63.9-79.36%) of the uncontrolled hypertensive patients. The TI was 22.42% (95% CI=24.2-37%) in the IG and 50% (95% CI=37.75-62.25) in the CG (p<.05) in visit 2, and 25.23% (95% CI=14.84-35.62) and 46.07% (95% CI=33.85-58.29) in the final visit for IG and CG, respectively (P<.05). The NI was 4.3.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: TI was very significant among the uncontrolled hypertensive patients. The studied interventions are effective for improving TI.Copyright A© 2010 Elsevier Espana, S.L. All rights reserved.

TI  - A culturally adapted telecommunication system to improve physical activity, diet quality, and medication adherence among hypertensive African-Americans: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is more prevalent and clinically severe among African-Americans than whites. Several health behaviors influence blood pressure (BP) control, but effective, accessible, culturally sensitive interventions that target multiple behaviors are lacking.
AB  - PURPOSE: We evaluated a culturally adapted, automated telephone system to help hypertensive, urban African-American adults improve their adherence to their antihypertensive medication regimen and to evidence-based guidelines for dietary behavior and physical activity.
AB  - METHODS: We randomized 337 hypertensive primary care patients to an 8-month automated, multi-behavior intervention or to an education-only control. Medication adherence, diet, physical activity, and BP were assessed at baseline and every 4 months for 1 year. Data were analyzed using longitudinal modeling.
AB  - RESULTS: The intervention was associated with improvements in a measure of overall diet quality (+3.5 points, p<0.03) and in energy expenditure (+80 kcal/day, p<0.03). A decrease in systolic BP between groups was not statistically significant (-2.3 mmHg, p=0.25).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Given their convenience, scalability, and ability to deliver tailored messages, automated telecommunications systems can promote self-management of diet and energy balance in urban African-Americans.

TI  - Comparison of associations of adherence to a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style diet with risks of cardiovascular disease and venous thromboembolism.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) share some risk factors, including obesity, but it is unclear how dietary patterns associated with reduced risk of CVD relate to risk of VTE.
AB  - OBJECTIVE:  To compare the relationships of adherence to a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style diet with the risks of CVD and VTE.
AB  - PATIENTS/METHODS: We confirmed by medical record review 1094 incident cases of CVD and 675 incident VTEs during a mean follow-up of 14.6 years in 34 827 initially healthy participants in the Women's Health Study who completed at baseline a 133-item food frequency questionnaire scored for adherence to a DASH diet. We compared estimated associations of dietary patterns with CVD and VTE from proportional hazards models in a competing risk framework.
AB  - RESULTS: Initial analyses adjusted for age, energy intake and randomized treatments showed 36-41% reduced hazards of CVD among women in the top two quintiles of DASH score relative to those in the bottom quintile (P(trend) < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, women in the top two quintiles had 12-23% reduced hazards of CVD relative to women in the bottom quintile (P(trend) = 0.04). Analyses restricted to coronary events showed more variable 10-33% reduced hazards in the top two quintiles (P(trend) = 0.09). In contrast, higher DASH scores were unrelated to risk of VTE, with a 1% reduced hazard for the top vs. bottom quintile (P(trend) = 0.95).
AB  - CONCLUSION: An apparently strong association of adherence to the DASH diet with incidence of CVD was attenuated upon control for confounding variables. Adherence to the DASH diet was not associated with risk of VTE in women.Copyright © 2011 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.

TI  - Qualitative analysis of peer coaches' experiences with counseling African Americans about reducing heart disease risk.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite mounting evidence that peer coaches can make significant contributions to patient health, little is known about factors that must be addressed to engage and retain them in their role.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify motivators and barriers to serving as a peer coach.
AB  - DESIGN: Open ended semi-structured interviews.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: In a randomized trial of peer support, patients with well controlled hypertension and good interpersonal skills were recruited and trained to serve as peer coaches for African-American patients from the same practices who had poorly controlled hypertension. Peer coaches spoke by telephone at least three times with their same sex patient-clients on alternate months during the 6-month intervention and counseled about medication adherence as well as other healthy lifestyles.
AB  - KEY RESULTS: Of 15 trained peer coaches, ten were contacted and agreed to participate in the qualitative interview. Peer coaches had a mean age of 66 years, 50% were women, and 80% were African-American. Themes regarding favorable aspects of the peer coach experience included: meaning and satisfaction derived from contributing to community health and the personal emotional and physical benefits derived from serving as a peer coach. Negative aspects centered on: challenges in establishing the initial telephone contact and wanting more information about their patient-clients' personal health conditions and status. Peer coaches endorsed gender matching but were less clear about race-matching.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Programs that utilize peer support to enhance positive health behaviors should recognize that a spirit of volunteerism motivates many successful peer coaches. Program planners should acknowledge the special characteristics required of successful peer coaches when selecting, motivating and training individuals for this role.

TI  - Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and bevacizumab for HER2-negative breast cancer.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor A, has shown clinical efficacy in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative metastatic breast cancer. We evaluated the efficacy, measured according to the rate of pathological complete response (absence of invasive and intraductal disease in the breast and the axillary lymph nodes), and the safety of adding bevacizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with early-stage breast cancer.
AB  - METHODS: We randomly assigned 1948 patients with a median tumor size of 40 mm on palpation to receive neoadjuvant epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel, with or without concomitant bevacizumab. Patients with untreated HER2-negative breast cancer were eligible if they had large tumors, hormone-receptor-negative disease, or hormone-receptor-positive disease with palpable nodes or positive findings on sentinel-node biopsy, and no increased cardiovascular or bleeding risk.
AB  - RESULTS: Overall, the rates of pathological complete response were 14.9% with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel and 18.4% with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel plus bevacizumab (odds ratio with addition of bevacizumab, 1.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.65; P=0.04); the corresponding rates of pathological complete response were 27.9% and 39.3% among 663 patients with triple-negative tumors (P=0.003) and 7.8% and 7.7% among 1262 patients with hormone-receptor-positive tumors (P=1.00). Breast-conserving surgery was possible in 66.6% of the patients in both groups. The addition of bevacizumab, as compared with neoadjuvant therapy alone, was associated with a higher incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxic effects (febrile neutropenia, mucositis, the hand-foot syndrome, infection, and hypertension) but with a similar incidence of surgical complications.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The addition of bevacizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy significantly increased the rate of pathological complete response among patients with HER2-negative early-stage breast cancer. Efficacy was restricted primarily to patients with triple-negative tumors, in whom the pathological complete response is considered to be a reliable predictor of long-term outcome.

TI  - Adherence therapy for medication non-compliant patients with hypertension: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  - The objective of this study is to establish the efficacy of adherence therapy (AT) compared with treatment as usual (TAU) in reducing blood pressure (BP) in non-compliant hypertensive patients. This study was designed as a parallel-group single-blind randomised controlled trial. The study was carried out at three general hospital outpatient clinics in Jordan. A total of 136 non-compliant hypertensive patients with a mean baseline BP of 164.5mmHg (s.d. 10.0) over 102.2mmHg (s.d. 7.0) participated in the study. 7 weekly 20-min sessions of AT in addition to TAU. The main outcome of this study is systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 11-weeks follow-up. In all, 68 patients received TAU and 68 AT. Intention-to-treat analysis included all participants randomised. AT lowered SBP by -23.11mmHg (95% CI: -25.85, -20.36) and diastolic BP (DBP) by -15.18mmHg (95% CI: -17.55, -12.80) at 11 weeks compared with TAU. Adherence (measured by pill counting) was also improved in the AT group by 37% at 11 weeks compared with TAU. No significant adverse events were reported. AT increases adherence to medication for hypertension which then leads to a clinically important reduction in BP.

TI  - Electronic monitoring of adherence, treatment of hypertension, and blood pressure control.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although it is generally acknowledged that electronic monitoring of adherence to treatment improves blood pressure (BP) control by increasing patients' awareness to their treatment, little information is available on the long-term effect of this intervention.
AB  - METHODS: In this observational study among a total of 470 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, adherence was measured in 228 patients by means of both the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) and pill count (intervention group), and in 242 patients by means of pill count alone (control group). During a follow-up period of 1 year consisting of seven visits to the physician's office, BP measurements were performed and medication adjusted based on the achieved BP. In addition, at each visit adherence to treatment was assessed.
AB  - RESULTS: On the basis of pill counts, median adherence to treatment did not differ between the intervention group and the control group (96.1% vs. 94.2%; P = 0.97). In both groups, systolic and diastolic BP decreased similarly: 23/13 vs. 22/12 mm Hg in the intervention and control group respectively. Drug changes and the number of drugs used were associated with BP at the start of study, but not with electronic monitoring.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In this study, electronic monitoring of adherence to treatment by means of MEMS did not lead to better long-term BP control nor did it result in less drug changes and drug use.

TI  - A Successful Multifaceted Trial to Improve Hypertension Control in Primary Care: Why Did it Work?.
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is important to understand which components of successful multifaceted interventions are responsible for study outcomes, since some components may be more important contributors to the intervention effect than others.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We conducted a mediation analysis to determine which of seven factors had the greatest effect on change in systolic blood pressure (BP) after 6 months in a trial to improve hypertension control.
AB  - DESIGN: The study was a preplanned secondary analysis of a cluster-randomized clinical trial. Eight clinics in an integrated health system were randomized to provide usual care to their patients (n=222), and eight were randomized to provide a telemonitoring intervention (n=228).
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred three of 450 trial participants completing the 6-month follow-up visit were included.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Intervention group participants received home BP telemonitors and transmitted measurements to pharmacists, who adjusted medications and provided advice to improve adherence to medications and lifestyle modification via telephone visits.
AB  - MAIN MEASURES: Path analytic models estimated indirect effects of the seven potential mediators of intervention effect (defined as the difference between the intervention and usual care groups in change in systolic BP from baseline to 6 months). The potential mediators were change in home BP monitor use, number of BP medication classes, adherence to BP medications, physical activity, salt intake, alcohol use, and weight.
AB  - KEY RESULTS: The difference in change in systolic BP was 11.3 mmHg. The multivariable mediation model explained 47 % (5.3 mmHg) of the intervention effect. Nearly all of this was mediated by two factors: an increase in medication treatment intensity (24 %) and increased home BP monitor use (19 %). The other five factors were not significant mediators, although medication adherence and salt intake improved more in the intervention group than in the usual care group.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Most of the explained intervention effect was attributable to the combination of self-monitoring and medication intensification. High adherence at baseline and the relatively low intensity of resources directed toward lifestyle change may explain why these factors did not contribute to the improvement in BP.

TI  - Evaluating the safety and efficacy of sodium-restricted/Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet after acute decompensated heart failure hospitalization: design and rationale for the Geriatric OUt of hospital Randomized MEal Trial in Heart Failure (GOURMET-HF).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem affecting predominantly older adults. Nonadherence to diet remains a significant contributor to acute decompensated HF (ADHF). The sodium-restricted Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH/SRD) eating plan reduces cardiovascular dysfunction that can lead to ADHF and is consistent with current HF guidelines. We propose that an intervention that promotes adherence to the DASH/SRD by home-delivering meals will be safe and improve health-related quality of life (QOL) in older adults after hospitalization for ADHF.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: This is a 3-center, randomized, single-blind, controlled trial of 12-week duration designed to determine the safety and efficacy of home-delivered DASH/SRD-compliant meals in older adults after discharge from ADHF hospitalization. Sixty-six subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 stratified fashion by gender and left ventricular ejection fraction (<50% vs >50%). Study subjects will receive either preprepared, home-delivered DASH/SRD-compliant meals or usual dietary advice for 4weeks after hospital discharge. Investigators will be blinded to group assignment, food diaries, and urinary electrolyte measurements until study completion. The primary efficacy end point is the change in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire summary scores for health-related QOL from study enrollment to 4weeks postdischarge. Safety evaluation will focus on hypotension, renal insufficiency, and hyperkalemia. Exploratory end points include echocardiography, noninvasive vascular testing, markers of oxidative stress, and salt taste sensitivity.
AB  - CONCLUSION: This randomized controlled trial will test the efficacy, feasibility, and safety of 4weeks of DASH/SRD after ADHF hospitalization. By testing a novel dietary intervention supported by multiple levels of evidence including preliminary data in outpatients with stable HF, we will address a critical evidence gap in the care of older patients with ADHF. If effective and safe, this intervention could be scaled to assess effects on readmission and healthcare costs in older adults after ADHF.Copyright Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Brief provider communication skills training fails to impact patient hypertension outcomes.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Hypertension remains a prevalent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and improved medication adherence leads to better blood pressure (BP) control. We sought to improve medication adherence and hypertension outcomes among patients with uncontrolled BP through communication skills training targeting providers.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of a communication skills intervention for primary care doctors compared to usual care controls, on the outcomes of BP (systolic, diastolic), patient self-reported medication adherence, and provider counseling, assessed at baseline and post-intervention. We enrolled 379 patients with uncontrolled BP; 203 (54%) with follow-up data comprised our final sample. We performed random effects least squares regression analyses to examine whether the provider training improved outcomes, using clinics as the unit of randomization.
AB  - RESULTS: In neither unadjusted nor multivariate analyses were significant differences in change detected from baseline to follow-up in provider counseling, medication adherence or BP, for the intervention versus control groups.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The intervention did not improve the outcomes; it may have been too brief and lacked sufficient practice level changes to impact counseling, adherence or BP.
AB  - PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Future intervention efforts may require more extensive provider training, along with broader systematic changes, to improve patient outcomes.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The effect of a community-based self-help multimodal behavioral intervention in Korean American seniors with high blood pressure.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Great strides have been made in improving heart health in the United States during the last 2 decades, yet these strides have not encompassed many ethnic minority populations. There are significant health disparity gaps stemming from both a paucity of valid research and a lack of culturally sensitive interventions. In particular, many Korean Americans with chronic illnesses encounter difficulty navigating the healthcare system because of limited health literacy.
AB  - METHODS: The effect of a multimodal Self-Help Intervention Program on the Control of High Blood Pressure (HBP) was tested in a community-based clinical trial for Korean American seniors. Of 440 seniors enrolled, 369 completed the study (184 in the intervention group and 185 in the control group; mean age = 70.9+/-5.3 years). The intervention group received 6 weekly educational sessions on HBP management skill building, including health literacy training, followed by telephone counseling and home blood pressure (BP) monitoring for 12 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Findings support that the Self-Help Intervention Program on the Control of HBP was effective in controlling BP in this ethnic/linguistic minority population. The BP control rates for the intervention and control groups were 49.5% vs. 43.2% at baseline, 58.5% vs. 42.4% at 6 months, 67.9% vs. 52.5% at 12 months, and 54.3% vs. 53.0% at 18 months. Significant changes were observed over time in some psychobehavioral outcomes, including self-efficacy for BP control, medication adherence behavior, HBP knowledge, and depression.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The study findings suggest that the multimodal Self-Help Intervention Program on the Control of HBP is effective at promoting optimal HBP control for this ethnic/linguistic minority population.

TI  - Improving adherence to glaucoma medication: a randomised controlled trial of a patient-centred intervention (The Norwich Adherence Glaucoma Study).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Improving adherence to ocular hypertension (OH)/glaucoma therapy is highly likely to prevent or reduce progression of optic nerve damage. The present study used a behaviour change counselling intervention to determine whether education and support was beneficial and cost-effective in improving adherence with glaucoma therapy.
AB  - METHODS: A randomised controlled trial with a 13-month recruitment and 8-month follow-up period was conducted. Patients with OH/glaucoma attending a glaucoma clinic and starting treatment with travoprost were approached. Participants were randomised into two groups and adherence was measured over 8 months, using an electronic monitoring device (Travalert dosing aid, TDA). The control group received standard clinical care, and the intervention group received a novel glaucoma education and motivational support package using behaviour change counselling. Cost-effectiveness framework analysis was used to estimate any potential cost benefit of improving adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: Two hundred and eight patients were recruited (102 intervention, 106 control). No significant difference in mean adherence over the monitoring period was identified with 77.2% (CI, 73.0, 81.4) for the control group and 74.8% (CI, 69.7, 79.9) for the intervention group (p = 0.47). Similarly, there was no significant difference in percentage intraocular pressure reduction; 27.6% (CI, 23.5, 31.7) for the control group and 25.3% (CI, 21.06, 29.54) for the intervention group (p = 0.45). Participants in the intervention group were more satisfied with information about glaucoma medication with a mean score of 14.47/17 (CI, 13.85, 15.0) compared with control group which was 8.51 (CI, 7.72, 9.30). The mean intervention cost per patient was GB10.35 (<US$16) and not cost-effective.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Adherence with travoprost was high and not further increased by the intervention. Nevertheless, the study demonstrated that provision of information, tailored to the individual, was inexpensive and able to achieve high patient satisfaction with respect to information about glaucoma medication. Measurement of adherence remains problematic since awareness of study participation may cause a change in participant behaviour.

TI  - Tailored Case Management for Diabetes and Hypertension (TEACH-DM) in a community population: study design and baseline sample characteristics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite recognition of the benefits associated with well-controlled diabetes and hypertension, control remains suboptimal. Effective interventions for these conditions have been studied within academic settings, but interventions targeting both conditions have rarely been tested in community settings. We describe the design and baseline results of a trial evaluating a behavioral intervention among community patients with poorly-controlled diabetes and comorbid hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: Tailored Case Management for Diabetes and Hypertension (TEACH-DM) is a 24-month randomized, controlled trial evaluating a telephone-delivered behavioral intervention for diabetes and hypertension versus attention control. The study recruited from nine community practices. The nurse-administered intervention targets 3 areas: 1) cultivation of healthful behaviors for diabetes and hypertension control; 2) provision of fundamentals to support attainment of healthful behaviors; and 3) identification and correction of patient-specific barriers to adopting healthful behaviors. Hemoglobin A1c and blood pressure measured at 6, 12, and 24 months are co-primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes include self-efficacy, self-reported medication adherence, exercise, and cost-effectiveness.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 377 randomized patients, 193 were allocated to the intervention and 184 to attention control. The cohort is balanced in terms of gender, race, education level, and income. The cohort's mean baseline hemoglobin A1c and blood pressure are above goal, and mean baseline body mass index falls in the obese range. Baseline self-reported non-adherence is high for diabetes and hypertension medications. Trial results are pending.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: If effective, the TEACH-DM intervention's telephone-based delivery strategy and nurse administration make it well-suited for rapid implementation and broad dissemination in community settings.Copyright © 2013.

TI  - Characteristics, drug combinations and dosages of primary care patients with uncontrolled ambulatory blood pressure and high medication adherence.
AB  - Most studies on the prevalence and determinants of resistant hypertension (RH) do not account for white coat hypertension, medication non-adherence, or use of suboptimal treatment dosages. We studied the characteristics, drug combinations, and dosages of patients on at least three antihypertensives of different classes who had uncontrolled blood pressure on 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and high medication adherence measured by electronic monitoring. The data were collected as part of the baseline measures of a hypertension control trial. Of 140 monitored primary care patients, all with uncontrolled office blood pressure, 69 (49%) were on at least three antihypertensives of different classes. Of these 69, 15 (22%) were controlled on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, 20 (29%) were uncontrolled and non-adherent, leaving only 34 (49%) adherent to their medications and having uncontrolled ambulatory hypertension (uncontrolled RH). Thirty-one (91%) of the 34 uncontrolled RH patients were prescribed a diuretic, of which 24 were on hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. Less than half of the patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, or calcium channel blocker were prescribed maximal doses of these agents. Half of the RH can be attributed to white coat effect and poor medication adherence, and all of the remaining patients were on apparently suboptimal drug combinations and/or dosages. Primary care physicians need to be educated regarding the optimal treatment of RH. Copyright © 2013 American Society of Hypertension. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Trial Using Motivational Interviewing and Positive Affect and Self-Affirmation in African-Americans with Hypertension (TRIUMPH): from theory to clinical trial implementation.
AB  - This paper describes the application of a translational research model in developing The Trial Using Motivational Interviewing and Positive Affect and Self-Affirmation in African-Americans with Hypertension (TRIUMPH), a theoretically-based, randomized controlled trial. TRIUMPH targets blood pressure control among African-Americans with hypertension in a community health center and public hospital setting. TRIUMPH applies positive affect, self-affirmation, and motivational interviewing as strategies to increase medication adherence and blood pressure control. A total of 220 participants were recruited in TRIUMPH and are currently being followed. This paper provides a detailed description of the theoretical framework and study design of TRIUMPH and concludes with a critical reflection of the lessons learned in the process of implementing a health behavior intervention in a community-based setting. TRIUMPH provides a model for incorporating the translational science research paradigm to conducting pragmatic behavioral trials in a real-world setting in a vulnerable population. Lessons learned through interactions with our community partners reinforce the value of community engagement in research.Copyright © 2013. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Protocol for a randomised controlled trial to estimate the effects and costs of a patient centred educational intervention in glaucoma management.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor glaucoma education is thought to be a causative factor of non-adherence to glaucoma therapy. However, the multi-factorial nature of non-adherent behaviour may explain the failure of purely educational interventions to achieve significant improvement in adherence. Behaviour Change Counselling (BCC) allows both the imparting of information and assessment of patient ambivalence to medication use and may elicit behaviour change in order to achieve better adherence. The chronic and complex nature of glaucoma means that patient non-adherence to glaucoma therapy does not easily correlate with measureable objective clinical endpoints. However, electronic medication monitoring offers an objective method of measuring adherence without reliance on clinical endpoints.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with glaucoma (open angle) or ocular hypertension patients attending a glaucoma clinic and prescribed travoprost. The study will determine whether additional glaucoma education using BCC is beneficial and cost effective in improving adherence with glaucoma therapy. An 8-month follow-up period, using an electronic adherence monitoring device (Travalert dosing aid, TDA), will indicate if the intervention is likely to be sustained in the longer term. Additionally, a cost-effectiveness framework will be used to estimate the cost benefit of improving adherence. The development of a novel intervention to deliver glaucoma education using BCC required practitioner training and fidelity testing. Five practitioners were successfully trained to become Glaucoma Support Assistants able to deliver the BCC intervention. The research group had prior clinical and investigative experience in this setting, and used multiple strategies to design a method to address the study objectives.
AB  - DISCUSSION: This RCT, using BCC to improve adherence to ocular hypotensive therapy, to our knowledge is the first within this disease area. Using a variety of adherence measures allows examination of the known inaccuracies of patient self-report with respect to glaucoma medication. The novel BCC component has undergone fidelity testing using BECCI and the BCC template will ensure conformity to a standardised intervention.

TI  - Factors associated with non-adherence to three hypertension self-management behaviors: preliminary data for a new instrument.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinicians have difficulty in identifying patients that are unlikely to adhere to hypertension self-management. Identifying non-adherence is essential to addressing suboptimal blood pressure control and high costs.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: 1) To identify risk factors associated with non-adherence to three key self-management behaviors in patients with hypertension: proper medication use, diet, and exercise; 2) To evaluate the extent to which an instrument designed to identify the number of risk factors present for non-adherence to each of the three hypertension self-management behaviors would be associated with self-management non-adherence and blood pressure.
AB  - DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of randomized trial data.
AB  - PATIENTS: Six hundred and thirty-six primary care patients with hypertension.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: 1) Demographic, socioeconomic, psychosocial, and health belief-related factors; 2) measures of self-reported adherence to recommended medication use, diet recommendations, and exercise recommendations, all collected at baseline assessment; 3) systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
AB  - RESULTS: We identified patient factors associated with measures of non-adherence to medications, diet, and exercise in hypertension. We then combined risk factors associated with >1 adherence measure into an instrument that generated three composite variables (medication, diet, and exercise composites), reflecting the number of risk factors present for non-adherence to the corresponding self-management behavior. These composite variables identified subgroups with higher likelihood of medication non-adherence, difficulty following diet recommendations, and difficulty following exercise recommendations. Composite variable levels representing the highest number of self-management non-adherence risk factors were associated with higher SBP and DBP.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: We identified factors associated with measures of non-adherence to recommended medication use, diet, and exercise in hypertension. We then developed an instrument that was associated with non-adherence to these self-management behaviors, as well as with blood pressure. With further study, this instrument has potential to improve identification of non-adherent patients with hypertension.

TI  - Reducing clinical inertia in hypertension treatment: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial.
AB  - Clinical inertia is a major contributor to poor blood pressure (BP) control. The authors tested the effectiveness of an intervention targeting physician, patient, and office system factors with regard to outcomes of clinical inertia and BP control. A total of 591 adult primary care patients with elevated BP (mean systolic BP > 140 mm Hg or mean diastolic BP > 90 mm Hg) were randomized to intervention or usual care. An outreach coordinator raised patient and provider awareness of unmet BP goals, arranged BP-focused primary care clinic visits, and furnished providers with treatment decision support. The intervention reduced clinical inertia (-29% vs -11%, P=.001). Nonetheless, change in BP did not differ between intervention and usual care (-10.1/-4.1 mm Hg vs -9.1/-4.5 mm Hg, P=.50 and 0.71 for systolic and diastolic BP, respectively). Future primary care-focused interventions might benefit from the use of specific medication titration protocols, treatment adherence support, and more sustained patient follow-up visits.Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Adherence to placebo and mortality in the Beta Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials have reported lower mortality among patients who adhere to placebo compared with those who do not. We explored this phenomenon by reanalyzing data from the placebo arm of the Beta Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of bucindolol and mortality.
AB  - AIMS: Our primary aim was to measure and explain the association between adherence to placebo and total mortality among the placebo-allocated participants in the BEST trial. Secondary aims included assessment of the association between placebo adherence and cause-specific mortality.
AB  - METHODS: Participants with "higher placebo adherence" were defined as having taken at least 75% of their placebo study medication over the entire course of each individual's participation in the study, while those with "lower placebo adherence" took <75%. Primary outcome was in-study all-cause mortality. To account for confounding, we adjusted for all available modifiable, non-modifiable and psychosocial variables.
AB  - RESULTS: Adherent participants had a significantly lower total mortality compared to less-adherent participants (HR=0.61, 95% Confidence Interval: 0.46-0.82). Adjusting for available confounders did not change the magnitude or significance of the estimates. When considering cause-specific mortality, CVD and pump failure showed similar associations.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Analyses of the BEST trial data support a strong association between adherence to placebo study medication and total mortality. While probably not due to publication bias or simple confounding by healthy lifestyle factors, the underlying explanation for the association remains a mystery. Prospective examination of this association is necessary to better understand the underlying mechanism of this observation.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Community Outreach and Cardiovascular Health (COACH) Trial: a randomized, controlled trial of nurse practitioner/community health worker cardiovascular disease risk reduction in urban community health centers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite well-publicized guidelines on the appropriate management of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, the implementation of risk-reducing practices remains poor. This report describes the results of a randomized, controlled clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness of a comprehensive program of cardiovascular disease risk reduction delivered by nurse practitioner /community health worker (NP/CHW) teams versus enhanced usual care (EUC) to improve lipids, blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and patient perceptions of the quality of their chronic illness care in patients in urban community health centers.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 525 patients with documented cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or hypertension and levels of LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, or HbA1c that exceeded goals established by national guidelines were randomly assigned to NP/CHW (n=261) or EUC (n=264) groups. The NP/CHW intervention included aggressive pharmacological management and tailored educational and behavioral counseling for lifestyle modification and problem solving to address barriers to adherence and control. Compared with EUC, patients in the NP/CHW group had significantly greater 12-month improvement in total cholesterol (difference, 19.7 mg/dL), LDL cholesterol (difference,15.9 mg/dL), triglycerides (difference, 16.3 mg/dL), systolic blood pressure (difference, 6.2 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (difference, 3.1 mm Hg), HbA1c (difference, 0.5%), and perceptions of the quality of their chronic illness care (difference, 1.2 points).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: An intervention delivered by an NP/CHW team using individualized treatment regimens based on treat-to-target algorithms can be an effective approach to improve risk factor status and perceptions of chronic illness care in high-risk patients.

TI  - Medication adherence among rural, low-income hypertensive adults: a randomized trial of a multimedia community-based intervention.
AB  - PURPOSE: Examine the effectiveness of a community-based, multimedia intervention on medication adherence among hypertensive adults.
AB  - DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.
AB  - SETTING: Rural south Alabama.
AB  - SUBJECTS: Low-income adults (N  =  434) receiving medication at no charge from a public health department or a Federally Qualified Health Center.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Both interventions were home-based and delivered via computer by a community health advisor. The adherence promotion (AP) intervention focused on theoretical variables related to adherence (e.g., barriers, decisional balance, and role models). The cancer control condition received general cancer information.
AB  - MEASURES: Adherence was assessed by pill count. Other adherence-related variables, including barriers, self-efficacy, depression, and sociodemographic variables, were collected via a telephone survey.
AB  - ANALYSIS: Chi-square analysis tested the hypothesis that a greater proportion of participants in the AP intervention are >80% adherent compared to the control group. General linear modeling examined adherence as a continuous variable.
AB  - RESULTS: Participants receiving the intervention did not differ from individuals in the control group (51% vs. 49% adherent, respectively; p  =  .67). Clinic type predicted adherence (p < .0001), as did forgetting to take medications (p  =  .01) and difficulty getting to the clinic to obtain medications (p < .001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Multilevel interventions that focus on individual behavior and community-level targets (e.g., how health care is accessed and delivered) may be needed to improve medication adherence among low-income rural residents.

TI  - Multicenter cluster-randomized trial of a multifactorial intervention to improve antihypertensive medication adherence and blood pressure control among patients at high cardiovascular risk (the COM99 study).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication nonadherence is common and results in preventable disease complications. This study assessed the effectiveness of a multifactorial intervention to improve both medication adherence and blood pressure control and to reduce cardiovascular events.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: In this multicenter, cluster-randomized trial, physicians from hospital-based hypertension clinics and primary care centers across Spain were randomized to receive and provide the intervention to their high-risk patients. Eligible patients were > 50 years of age, had uncontrolled hypertension, and had an estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk greater than 30%. Physicians randomized to the intervention group counted patients' pills, designated a family member to support adherence behavior, and provided educational information to patients. The primary outcome was blood pressure control at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included both medication adherence and a composite end point of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations. Seventy-nine physicians and 877 patients participated in the trial. The mean duration of follow-up was 39 months. Intervention patients were less likely to have an uncontrolled systolic blood pressure (odds ratio 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.50 to 0.78) and were more likely to be adherent (odds ratio 1.91, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 3.05) than control group patients at 6 months. After 5 years, 16% of the patients in the intervention group and 19% in the control group met the composite end point (hazard ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 1.39).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A multifactorial intervention to improve adherence to antihypertensive medication was effective in improving both adherence and blood pressure control, but it did not appear to improve long-term cardiovascular events.

TI  - Coronary heart disease in moderately hypercholesterolemic, hypertensive black and non-black patients randomized to pravastatin versus usual care: the antihypertensive and lipid lowering to prevent heart attack trial (ALLHAT-LLT).
AB  - BACKGROUND: In previous analyses in ALLHAT, blacks had a significantly lower risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in the pravastatin group compared to the usual care group, whereas non-blacks had no benefit from pravastatin. No previous statin trial has reported results separately in blacks.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to determine if apparent racial differences in CHD in ALLHAT are explained by differences in baseline characteristics, adherence during the trial, or achieved blood pressure and lipid lowering.
AB  - METHODS: This was a prespecified subgroup analysis of a randomized controlled trial. Hypertensive, moderately hypercholesterolemic participants were assigned to open-label pravastatin (40 mg/d) or usual care. The outcome was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD. We performed intention-to-treat survival analyses using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for baseline covariates (age, sex, aspirin use, history of CHD and diabetes, and baseline hypertension treatment) and time-varying levels of blood pressure and total cholesterol.
AB  - RESULTS: After adjustment for baseline characteristics, there remained a significant interaction between race and treatment group (P = .02). In stratified models, blacks in the pravastatin group had a 29% lower risk of CHD (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71, 95% CI 0.57-0.90, P = .005) compared to those in the usual care group, whereas non-blacks had no benefit (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85-1.19, P = .95). With further adjustment for achieved blood pressure and total cholesterol, the HR in blacks was 0.65 (95% CI 0.45-0.96, P = .03) and in non-blacks was 1.07 (95% CI 0.81-1.41, P = .65).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that pravastatin is effective in preventing CHD in blacks.

TI  - Clinical inertia: a common barrier to changing provider prescribing behavior.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A cross-sectional content analysis nested within a randomized, controlled trial was conducted to collect information on provider responses to computer alerts regarding guideline recommendations for patients with suboptimal hypertension care.
AB  - METHODS: Participants were providers who cared for 1,017 patients with uncontrolled hypertension on a single antihypertensive agent within Veterans Affairs primary care clinics. All reasons for action or inaction were sorted into a framework to explain the variation in guideline adaptation.
AB  - RESULTS: The 184 negative provider responses to computer alerts contained explanations for not changing patient treatment; 76 responses to the alerts were positive, that is, the provider was going to make a change in antihypertensive regimen. The negative responses were categorized as: inertia of practice (66%), lack of agreement with specific guidelines (5%), patient-based factors (17%), environmental factors (10%), and lack of knowledge (2%). Most of the 135 providers classified as inertia of practice indicated, "Continue current medications and I will discuss at the next visit." The median number of days until the next visit was 45 days (interquartile range, 29 to 78 days).
AB  - DISCUSSION: Clinical inertia was the primary reason for failing to engage in otherwise indicated treatment change in a subgroup of patients. A framework was provided as a taxonomy for classification of provider barriers.

TI  - Multifaceted Prospective Memory Intervention to Improve Medication Adherence.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To test whether a multifaceted prospective memory intervention improved adherence to antihypertensive medications and to assess whether executive function and working memory processes moderated the intervention effects.
AB  - DESIGN: Two-group longitudinal randomized control trial.
AB  - SETTING: Community.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 65 and older without signs of dementia or symptoms of severe depression who were self-managing prescribed medication.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: After 4 weeks of initial adherence monitoring using a medication event monitoring system, individuals with 90% or less adherence were randomly assigned to groups.
AB  - INTERVENTION: The prospective memory intervention was designed to provide strategies that switch older adults from relying on executive function and working memory processes (that show effects of cognitive aging) to mostly automatic associative processes (that are relatively spared with normal aging) for remembering to take medications. Strategies included establishing a routine, establishing cues strongly associated with medication taking actions, performing the action immediately upon thinking about it, using a medication organizer, and imagining medication taking to enhance encoding and improve cuing.
AB  - RESULTS: There was significant improvement in adherence in the intervention group (57% at baseline to 78% after the intervention), but most of these gains were lost after 5 months. The control condition started at 68% and was stable during the intervention, but dropped to 62%. Executive function and working memory moderated the intervention effect, with the intervention producing greater benefit for those with lower executive function and working memory.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The intervention improved adherence, but the benefits were not sustained. Further research is needed to determine how to sustain the substantial initial benefits.© 2016, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation © 2016, The American Geriatrics Society.

TI  - Positive airway pressure improves nocturnal beat-to-beat blood pressure surges in obesity hypoventilation syndrome with obstructive sleep apnea.
AB  - Positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment has been shown to have a modest effect on ambulatory blood pressure (BP) in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, there is a paucity of data on the effect of PAP therapy on rapid, yet significant, BP swings during sleep, particularly in obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). The present study hypothesizes that PAP therapy will improve nocturnal BP on the first treatment night (titration PAP) in OHS patients with underlying OSA, and that these improvements will become more significant with 6 wk of PAP therapy. Seventeen adults (7 men, 10 women; age 50.4 +/- 10.7 years, BMI 49.3 +/- 2.4 kg/m(2)) with OHS and clinically diagnosed OSA participated in three overnight laboratory visits that included polysomnography and beat-to-beat BP monitoring via finger plethysmography. Six weeks of PAP therapy, but not titration PAP, lowered mean nocturnal BP. In contrast, when nocturnal beat-to-beat BPs were aggregated into bins consisting of at least three consecutive cardiac cycles with a >10 mmHg BP surge (i.e., DELTA10-20, DELTA20-30, DELTA30-40, and DELTA>40 mmHg), titration, and 6-wk PAP reduced the number of BP surges per hour (time x bin, P < 0.05). PAP adherence over the 6-wk period was significantly correlated to reductions in nocturnal systolic (r = 0.713, P = 0.001) and diastolic (r = 0.497, P = 0.043) BP surges. Despite these PAP-induced improvements in nocturnal beat-to-beat BP surges, 6 wk of PAP therapy did not alter daytime BP. In conclusion, PAP treatment reduces nocturnal beat-to-beat BP surges in OHS patients with underlying OSA, and this improvement in nocturnal BP regulation was greater in patients with higher PAP adherence.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We assessed the effect of automated treatment adherence support delivered via mobile phone short message system (SMS) text messages on blood pressure.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: In this pragmatic, single-blind, 3-arm, randomized trial (SMS-Text Adherence Support [StAR]) undertaken in South Africa, patients treated for high blood pressure were randomly allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to information only, interactive SMS text messaging, or usual care. The primary outcome was change in systolic blood pressure at 12 months from baseline measured with a validated oscillometric device. All trial staff were masked to treatment allocation. Analyses were intention to treat. Between June 26, 2012, and November 23, 2012, 1372 participants were randomized to receive information-only SMS text messages (n=457), interactive SMS text messages (n=458), or usual care (n=457). Primary outcome data were available for 1256 participants (92%). At 12 months, the mean adjusted change in systolic blood pressure compared with usual care was -2.2 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, -4.4 to -0.04) with information-only SMS and -1.6 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, -3.7 to 0.6) with interactive SMS. Odds ratios for the proportion of participants with a blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg were 1.42 (95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.95) for information-only messaging and 1.41 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.95) for interactive messaging compared with usual care.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized trial of an automated adherence support program delivered by SMS text message in a general outpatient population of adults with high blood pressure, we found a small reduction in systolic blood pressure control compared with usual care at 12 months. There was no evidence that an interactive intervention increased this effect.

TI  - The FAITH Trial: Baseline Characteristics of a Church-based Trial to Improve Blood Pressure Control in Blacks.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the baseline characteristics of participants in the Faith-based Approaches in the Treatment of Hypertension (FAITH) Trial.
AB  - DESIGN: FAITH evaluates the effectiveness of a faith-based lifestyle intervention vs health education control on blood pressure (BP) reduction among hypertensive Black adults.
AB  - SETTING PARTICIPANTS AND MAIN MEASURES: Participants included 373 members of 32 Black churches in New York City. Baseline data collected included participant demographic characteristics, clinical measures (eg, blood pressure), behaviors (eg, diet, physical activity), and psychosocial factors (eg, self-efficacy, depressive symptoms).
AB  - RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 63.4 +/- 11.9 years and 76% were female. About half completed at least some college (53%), 66% had an income >$20,000, and 42.2% were retired or on disability. Participants had a mean systolic and diastolic BP of 152.1 +/- 16.8 mm Hg and 86.2 +/- 12.2 mm Hg, respectively, and a mean BMI of 32 kg/m2. Hypertension (HTN) medications were taken by 95% of participants, but most (79.1%) reported non-adherence to their regimen. Participants reported consuming 3.4 +/- 2.6 servings of fruits and vegetables and received 30.9% of their energy from fat. About one-third (35.9%) reported a low activity level.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Participants in the FAITH trial exhibited several adverse clinical and behavioral characteristics at baseline. Future analyses will evaluate the effectiveness of the faith-based lifestyle intervention on changes in BP and lifestyle behaviors among hypertensive Black adults.

TI  - A Multicomponent Behavioral Intervention to Reduce Stroke Risk Factor Behaviors: The Stroke Health and Risk Education Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Stroke Health and Risk Education Project was a cluster-randomized, faith-based, culturally sensitive, theory-based multicomponent behavioral intervention trial to reduce key stroke risk factor behaviors in Hispanics/Latinos and European Americans.
AB  - METHODS: Ten Catholic churches were randomized to intervention or control group. The intervention group received a 1-year multicomponent intervention (with poor adherence) that included self-help materials, tailored newsletters, and motivational interviewing counseling calls. Multilevel modeling, accounting for clustering within subject pairs and parishes, was used to test treatment differences in the average change since baseline (ascertained at 6 and 12 months) in dietary sodium, fruit and vegetable intake, and physical activity, measured using standardized questionnaires. A priori, the trial was considered successful if any one of the 3 outcomes was significant at the 0.05/3 level.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 801 subjects who consented, 760 completed baseline data assessments, and of these, 86% completed at least one outcome assessment. The median age was 53 years; 84% subjects were Hispanic/Latino; and 64% subjects were women. The intervention group had a greater increase in fruit and vegetable intake than the control group (0.25 cups per day [95% confidence interval: 0.08, 0.42], P=0.002), a greater decrease in sodium intake (-123.17 mg/d [-194.76, -51.59], P=0.04), but no difference in change in moderate- or greater-intensity physical activity (-27 metabolic equivalent-minutes per week [-526, 471], P=0.56).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This multicomponent behavioral intervention targeting stroke risk factors in predominantly Hispanics/Latinos was effective in increasing fruit and vegetable intake, reaching its primary end point. The intervention also seemed to lower sodium intake. Church-based health promotions can be successful in primary stroke prevention efforts.

TI  - Effect of Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Lutein/Zeaxanthin, or Other Nutrient Supplementation on Cognitive Function: The AREDS2 Randomized Clinical Trial.
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Observational data have suggested that high dietary intake of saturated fat and low intake of vegetables may be associated with increased risk of Alzheimer disease.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the effects of oral supplementation with nutrients on cognitive function.
AB  - DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a double-masked randomized clinical trial (the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 [AREDS2]), retinal specialists in 82 US academic and community medical centers enrolled and observed participants who were at risk for developing late age-related macular degeneration (AMD) from October 2006 to December 2012. In addition to annual eye examinations, several validated cognitive function tests were administered via telephone by trained personnel at baseline and every 2 years during the 5-year study.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) (1 g) and/or lutein (10 mg)/zeaxanthin (2 mg) vs placebo were tested in a factorial design. All participants were also given varying combinations of vitamins C, E, beta carotene, and zinc.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was the yearly change in composite scores determined from a battery of cognitive function tests from baseline. The analyses, which were adjusted for baseline age, sex, race, history of hypertension, education, cognitive score, and depression score, evaluated the differences in the composite score between the treated vs untreated groups. The composite score provided an overall score for the battery, ranging from -22 to 17, with higher scores representing better function.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 89% (3741/4203) of AREDS2 participants consented to the ancillary cognitive function study and 93.6% (3501/3741) underwent cognitive function testing. The mean (SD) age of the participants was 72.7 (7.7) years and 57.5% were women. There were no statistically significant differences in change of scores for participants randomized to receive supplements vs those who were not. The yearly change in the composite cognitive function score was -0.19 (99% CI, -0.25 to -0.13) for participants randomized to receive LCPUFAs vs -0.18 (99% CI, -0.24 to -0.12) for those randomized to no LCPUFAs (difference in yearly change, -0.03 [99% CI, -0.20 to 0.13]; P=.63). Similarly, the yearly change in the composite cognitive function score was -0.18 (99% CI, -0.24 to -0.11) for participants randomized to receive lutein/zeaxanthin vs -0.19 (99% CI, -0.25 to -0.13) for those randomized to not receive lutein/zeaxanthin (difference in yearly change, 0.03 [99% CI, -0.14 to 0.19]; P=.66). Analyses were also conducted to assess for potential interactions between LCPUFAs and lutein/zeaxanthin and none were found to be significant.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among older persons with AMD, oral supplementation with LCPUFAs or lutein/zeaxanthin had no statistically significant effect on cognitive function.

TI  - Effects of a behavioral intervention that emphasizes spices and herbs on adherence to recommended sodium intake: results of the SPICE randomized clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: For decades, dietary sodium intake in the United States has remained high, and few studies have examined strategies for maintaining recommended intakes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined the effects of a behavioral intervention, which emphasized spices and herbs, on the maintenance of sodium intake at the recommended intake of 1500 mg/d in individuals to whom the US Dietary Guidelines for Americans apply.
AB  - DESIGN: We conducted a 2-phase study that included adults >18 y of age for whom Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends 1500 mg Na/d. The study was conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, from 2012 to 2014. In phase 1, 55 individuals consumed a low-sodium diet for 4 wk. Participants were provided all foods, snacks, and calorie-containing drinks. In phase 2, 40 participants from phase 1 were randomly assigned to either a behavioral intervention to reduce sodium intake (n = 20) or a self-directed control group (n = 20) for 20 wk. The primary study outcome was the change in mean 24-h urinary sodium excretion during phase 2. Linear regression analyses were used to determine intervention effects on urinary sodium excretion.
AB  - RESULTS: Participant characteristics were as follows: women: 65%; African American: 88%; hypertension: 63%; diabetes: 18%; mean age: 61 y; and mean body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 30. At the end of phase 2, mean 24-h sodium excretion was lower in the behavioral intervention than in the self-directed group (mean difference: -956.8 mg/d; 95% CI: -1538.7, -374.9 mg/d) after sodium intake at screening was controlled for (P = 0.002). These findings persisted in sensitivity analyses that excluded potentially incomplete urine collections [Mage's equation mean difference: -1090 mg/d (P = 0.001); Joosens' equation mean difference: -796 mg/d (P = 0.04)].
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A multifactorial behavioral intervention emphasizing spices and herbs significantly reduced sodium intake. Because of the ubiquity of sodium in the US food supply, multilevel strategies addressing individual behaviors and the food supply are needed to improve adherence to recommendations.

TI  - Monotherapy versus dual therapy for the initial treatment of hypertension (PATHWAY-1): a randomised double-blind controlled trial.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have suggested that more intensive initial therapy for hypertension results in better long-term blood pressure (BP) control. We test this hypothesis comparing initial monotherapy with dual therapy in the management of essential hypertension.
AB  - METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is a prospective, multicentre, double-blind, active-controlled trial in patients with essential hypertension. Around 50% of patients studied will be newly diagnosed and the others will be known hypertensives who previously received only monotherapy. The trial is divided into three phases as follows: Phase 1 (Week 0-Week 16): Randomised, parallel-group, masked assignation to either combination or monotherapy. Phase 2 (Week 17-Week 32): Open-label combination therapy. Phase 3 (Week 33-Week 52): Open-label combination therapy plus open-label add-on (if BP is above 140/90 mm Hg). Hierarchical primary end points are: a comparison of home BP (home systolic blood pressure (HSBP)) averaged over the duration of phase 1 and 2 in the combination versus monotherapy arms. If combination is superior in this analysis, then the averaged mean HSBP between initial monotherapy and initial combination therapy at the end of phase 2 will be compared. Secondary end points include: BP control at 1 year; the role of age, baseline renin, sodium status, plasma volume, haemodynamic compensation and peripheral resistance on BP control; validation of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence/British Hypertension Society joint guideline algorithm; safety and tolerability of combination therapy; and the impact of combination versus monotherapy on left ventricular mass and aortic pulse wave velocity. A sample size of 536 (268 in each group) will have 90% power to detect a difference in means of 4 mm Hg.
AB  - ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: PATHWAY 1 was approved by UK ethics (REC Reference 09/H0308/132). Trial results will be published and all participating subjects will be informed of the results.

TI  - Medication adherence and visit-to-visit variability of systolic blood pressure in African Americans with chronic kidney disease in the AASK trial.
AB  - Lower adherence to antihypertensive medications may increase visit-to-visit variability of blood pressure (VVV of BP), a risk factor for cardiovascular events and death. We used data from the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) trial to examine whether lower medication adherence is associated with higher systolic VVV of BP in African Americans with hypertensive chronic kidney disease (CKD). Determinants of VVV of BP were also explored. AASK participants (n=988) were categorized by self-report or pill count as having perfect (100%), moderately high (75-99%), moderately low (50-74%) or low (<50%) proportion of study visits with high medication adherence over a 1-year follow-up period. We used multinomial logistic regression to examine determinants of medication adherence, and multivariable-adjusted linear regression to examine the association between medication adherence and systolic VVV of BP, defined as the coefficient of variation or the average real variability (ARV). Participants with lower self-reported adherence were generally younger and had a higher prevalence of comorbid conditions. Compared with perfect adherence, moderately high, moderately low and low adherence was associated with 0.65% (+/-0.31%), 0.99% (+/-0.31%) and 1.29% (+/-0.32%) higher systolic VVV of BP (defined as the coefficient of variation) in fully adjusted models. Results were qualitatively similar when using ARV or when using pill counts as the measure of adherence. Lower medication adherence is associated with higher systolic VVV of BP in African Americans with hypertensive CKD; efforts to improve medication adherence in this population may reduce systolic VVV of BP.

TI  - Case Study: Community Engagement and Clinical Trial Success: Outreach to African American Women.
AB  - This brief report examines how the use of community engagement principles and approaches enhanced clinical trial recruitment and retention. The Community-Engaged Research Core (CERC), a CTSA-supported resource designed to facilitate community involvement in clinical and translational research, was consulted to provide assistance with the implementation of the clinical trial, and specifically to enhance participation of the target population-African American women. CERC's key recommendations included: (1) convene a Community Engagement Studio, (2) redesign the recruitment advertisement, (3) simplify the language used to explain the scope of the study, and (4) provide transportation for participants. As a result of these interventions, a comprehensive strategy to recruit, enroll, and retain participants was formulated. After implementation of the plan by the study team, enrollment increased 78% and recruitment goals were met 16 months ahead of schedule. Participant retention and study drug adherence was 100%. We conclude that community engagement is essential to the development of an effective multifaceted plan to improve recruitment of underrepresented groups in clinical trials.

TI  - Performance and persistence of a blood pressure self-management intervention: telemonitoring and self-management in hypertension (TASMINH2) trial.
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate, in detail, the implementation of the self-management intervention used in the TASMINH2 trial. The intervention, comprising self-monitoring for the first week of each month and an individualised treatment self-titration schedule, was developed from a previous trial of self-management. Two hundred and sixty-three patients with poorly controlled but treated hypertension were randomised to receive this intervention and underwent training over two or three sessions. Participants were followed up for 12 months during which time process data were collected regarding the persistence and fidelity of actual behaviour compared with intervention recommendations. Two hundred and forty-one (92%) patients completed training of whom 188 (72%) self-managed their BP and completed at least 90% of expected self-monitoring measurements for the full year of the study. Overall, 268/483 (55%) of recommended medication changes were implemented. Only 25 (13%) patients had controlled BP throughout the year and so were not recommended any medication changes. Adherence to the protocol reduced over time as the number of potential changes increased. Of those self-managing throughout, 131 (70%) made at least one medication change, with 77 (41%) implementing all their recommended changes. In conclusion, self-management of hypertension was possible in practice with most participants making at least one medication change. Although adherence to the intervention reduced over time, implementation of treatment recommendations appeared better than equivalent trials using physician titration. Future self-management interventions should aim to better support patients' decision making, perhaps through enhanced use of technology.

TI  - Knowledge and adherence to antihypertensive therapy in primary care: results of a randomized trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of a healthcare education program for patients with hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: A multicenter, prospective, cluster-randomized trial was conducted. Randomization was by primary care center; 18 of 36 urban primary care centers in Barcelona and its metropolitan area were randomized to the intervention group (IG) and 18 to the control group (CG). The study sample consisted of patients with hypertension (n=996; 515 in the IG and 481 in the CG) receiving outpatient treatment with antihypertensive drugs. The intervention consisted of personalized information by a trained nurse and written leaflets. Questionnaires on knowledge and awareness of hypertension and its medication, treatment adherence, healthy lifestyle habits, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and body mass index were assessed at each visit, with a 12-month follow-up. An intention-to-treat analysis was applied.
AB  - RESULTS: Knowledge of hypertension increased by 27.8% in the IG and by 18.5% in the CG, while that of medication increased by 10.1% in the IG and 5.5% in the CG. Treatment adherence measured by the Morisky-Green test increased by 9.6% (95% CI: 5.5-13.6) in the IG and 8.8% (95% CI: 4.9-12.6) in the CG. There were no differences in adherence on the other tests used. No differences were observed between the IG and CG in clinical variables such as blood pressure or BMI at the end of the trial.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The educational intervention had no significant impact on patients' adherence to the medication.Copyright © 2010 SESPAS. Published by Elsevier Espana. All rights reserved.

TI  - Rationale and design of a randomized controlled trial evaluating community health worker-based interventions for the secondary prevention of acute coronary syndromes in India (SPREAD).
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a need to evaluate and implement cost-effective strategies to improve adherence to treatments in coronary heart disease. There are no studies from low- to middle income countries (LMICs) evaluating trained community health worker (CHW)-based interventions for the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease.
AB  - METHODS: We designed a hospital-based, open randomized trial of CHW-based interventions versus standard care. Patients after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were randomized to an intervention group (a CHW-based intervention package, comprising education tools to enhance self-care and adherence, and regular follow-up by the CHW) or to standard care for 12 months during which study outcomes were recorded. The CHWs were trained over a period of 6 months. The primary outcome measure was medication adherence. The secondary outcomes were differences in adherence to lifestyle modification, physiological parameters (blood pressure [BP], body weight, body mass index [BMI], heart rate, lipids), and major adverse cardiovascular events.
AB  - RESULTS: We recruited 806 patients stabilized after an ACS from 14 hospitals in 13 Indian cities. The mean age was 56.4 (+/- 11.32) years, and 17.2% were females. A high prevalence of risk factors such as hypertension (43.4%), diabetes (31.9%), tobacco consumption (35.4%), and inadequate physical activity (70.5%) was documented. A little over half had ST-elevation myocardial infarction (53.7%), and 46.3% had non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The CHW interventions and training for SPREAD have been developed and adapted for local use. The results and experience of this study will be important to counter the burden of cardiovascular diseases in low- to middle income countries.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Reinforcing adherence to antihypertensive medications.
AB  - This pilot study evaluated a reinforcement intervention to improve adherence to antihypertensive therapy. Twenty-nine participants were randomized to standard care or standard care plus financial reinforcement for 12 weeks. Participants in the reinforcement group received a cell phone to self-record videos of adherence, for which they earned rewards. These participants sent videos demonstrating on-time adherence 97.8% of the time. Pill count adherence differed significantly between the groups during treatment, with 98.8%+/-1.5% of pills taken during treatment in the reinforcement condition vs 92.6%+/-9.2% in standard care (P<.002). Benefits persisted throughout a 3-month follow-up, with 93.8%+/-9.3% vs 78.0%+/-18.5% of pills taken (P<.001). Pill counts correlated significantly (P<.001) with self-reports of adherence, which also differed between groups over time (P<.01). Systolic blood pressure decreased modestly over time in participants overall (P<.01) but without significant time-by-group effects. These results suggest that reinforcing medication adherence via cellular phone technology and financial reinforcement holds potential to improve adherence.Copyright © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Medication non-adherence after myocardial infarction: an exploration of modifying factors.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication non-adherence is a major impediment to the management of cardiovascular disease risk factors. A better understanding of the modifying factors underlying medication non-adherence among individuals with known cardiovascular disease may inform approaches for addressing non-adherence.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify demographic and patient characteristics, medical comorbidities, psychosocial factors, and health belief-related factors associated with medication non-adherence among patients with known cardiovascular disease.
AB  - DESIGN: We performed secondary analysis of baseline data from a randomized trial.
AB  - PATIENTS: The study included 405 patients with a diagnosis of hypertension and history of acute myocardial infarction that was diagnosed within a three-year period prior to enrollment.
AB  - MAIN MEASURES: Baseline demographics and patient characteristics, medical comorbidities, psychosocial factors, health belief-related factors, and patient-reported medication non-adherence were analyzed.
AB  - KEY RESULTS: Of 405 patients, 173 (42.7 %) reported medication non-adherence. Factors associated with non-adherence in bivariate analysis included younger age, non-white race, having less than 12 years of education, smoking, financial insecurity, identifying as nervous or tense, higher life chaos score, greater worry about having a myocardial infarction, and greater worry about having a stroke. Using multivariable modeling, we determined that age (OR 0.97 per additional year, 95 % CI, 0.95-0.99), life chaos (OR 1.06 per additional point, 95 % CI, 1.00-1.11), and worry about stroke (OR 1.12 per additional point, 95 % CI, 1.01-1.25) remained significantly associated with self-reported medication non-adherence.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: We found that worry about having a stroke, higher life chaos, and younger age were all significantly associated with self-reported medication non-adherence in patients with cardiovascular disease and a history of myocardial infarction. Further research exploring these factors as targets for intervention is needed, as is additional research examining modifiable causes of medication non-adherence among patients with cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Impact of a community health workers-led structured program on blood glucose control among latinos with type 2 diabetes: the DIALBEST trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Latinos with type 2 diabetes (T2D) face major healthcare access and disease management disparities. We examined the impact of the Diabetes Among Latinos Best Practices Trial (DIALBEST), a community health worker (CHW)-led structured intervention for improving glycemic control among Latinos with T2D.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 211 adult Latinos with poorly controlled T2D were randomly assigned to a standard of healthcare (n = 106) or CHW (n = 105) group. The CHW intervention comprised 17 individual sessions delivered at home by CHWs over a 12-month period. Sessions addressed T2D complications, healthy lifestyles, nutrition, healthy food choices and diet for diabetes, blood glucose self-monitoring, and medication adherence. Demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, anthropometric, and biomarker (HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, and lipid profile) data were collected at baseline and 3, 6, 12, and 18 months (6 months postintervention). Groups were equivalent at baseline.
AB  - RESULTS: Participants had high HbA1c at baseline (mean 9.58% [81.2 mmol/mol]). Relative to participants in the control group, CHWs had a positive impact on net HbA1c improvements at 3 months (-0.42% [-4.62 mmol/mol]), 6 months (-0.47% [-5.10 mmol/mol]), 12 months (-0.57% [-6.18 mmol/mol]), and 18 months (-0.55% [-6.01 mmol/mol]). The overall repeated-measures group effect was statistically significant (mean difference -0.51% [-5.57 mmol/mol], 95% CI -0.83, -0.19% [-9.11, -2.03 mmol/mol], P = 0.002). CHWs had an overall significant effect on fasting glucose concentration that was more pronounced at the 12- and 18-month visits. There was no significant effect on blood lipid levels, hypertension, and weight.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: DIALBEST is an effective intervention for improving blood glucose control among Latinos with T2D.Copyright © 2015 by the American Diabetes Association.

TI  - Effect of a low-fat or low-carbohydrate weight-loss diet on markers of cardiovascular risk among premenopausal women: a randomized trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low-fat and low-carbohydrate weight-loss diets can have a beneficial effect on longitudinal measures of blood pressure and blood lipids. We aimed to assess longitudinal changes in blood pressure and blood lipids in a population of premenopausal women. We hypothesized that results may differ by level of adherence to the respective diet protocol and baseline presence of hypertension or hyperlipidemia.
AB  - METHODS: Overweight or obese premenopausal women were randomized to a low-fat (n=41) or low-carbohydrate (n=38) diet. As part of the 52-week Lifestyle Eating and Fitness (LEAF) intervention trial, we fit linear mixed models to determine whether a change in outcome differed by treatment arm.
AB  - RESULTS: Within-group trends in blood pressure and blood lipids did not differ (p>0.30). Across study arms, there was a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP, 3mm Hg, p=0.01) over time, but diastolic blood pressure (DBP) did not change significantly over the course of the study. Blood lipids (total cholesterol [TC], low-density lipoproteins [LDL], and high-density lipoproteins [HDL]) all exhibited nonlinear trends over time (p<0.01); each decreased initially but returned to levels comparable to baseline by study conclusion (p>0.20). We observed a decline in SBP among women who were hypertensive at baseline (p<0.01), but hypercholesterolemia at baseline did not affect trends in blood lipids (p>0.40).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Our results support that dietary interventions may be efficacious for lowering blood pressure and blood lipids among overweight or obese premenopausal women. However, a decrease in SBP was the only favorable change that was sustained in this study population. These changes can be maintained over the course of a 1-year intervention, yet changes in blood lipids may be less sustainable.

TI  - Relationships among stressful life events and physiological markers, treatment adherence, and psychosocial functioning among youth with type 2 diabetes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationships between stressful life events and physiological measures, adherence to prescribed oral medication regimens, depressive symptoms, and impaired quality of life (QoL) in adolescents with recent-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D).
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Data were collected from 497 ethnically diverse participants (66% female) in the final year of the Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth multicenter clinical trial. Exposure to 32 possible events over the previous year and rating of subsequent distress were collected by self-report and summarized as a major stressors score. This score was analyzed for relationship to glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c and treatment failure), body mass index, diagnosis of hypertension or triglyceride dyslipidemia, adherence to a prescribed oral medication regimen, presence of depressive symptoms, and impaired QoL.
AB  - RESULTS: The total number of major stressful life events in the adolescents with T2D was calculated, with 33% reporting none, 67% reporting > 1, 47% reporting > 2, 33% reporting > 3, and 20% reporting > 4. There were no associations between the major stressors score and physiological measures or diagnosis of comorbidities. The odds of medication nonadherence increased significantly from those reporting > 1 major stressor (OR, 1.58; P = .0265) to those reporting > 4 major stressors (OR, 2.70; P = .0009). Significant odds of elevated depressive symptoms and impaired QoL were also found with increased reporting of major stressors.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Exposure to major stressful life events is associated with lower adherence to prescribed oral medication regimens and impaired psychosocial functioning in adolescents with T2D.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - A cluster-randomized trial of task shifting and blood pressure control in Ghana: study protocol.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are experiencing an epidemic of cardiovascular disease (CVD) propelled by rapidly increasing rates of hypertension. Barriers to hypertension control in SSA include poor access to care and high out-of-pocket costs. Although SSA bears 24% of the global disease burden, it has only 3% of the global health workforce. Given such limited resources, cost-effective strategies, such as task shifting, are needed to mitigate the rising CVD epidemic in SSA. Ghana, a country in SSA with an established community health worker program integrated within a national health insurance scheme provides an ideal platform to evaluate implementation of the World Health Organization (WHO) task-shifting strategy. This study will evaluate the comparative effectiveness of the implementation of the WHO Package targeted at CV risk assessment versus provision of health insurance coverage, on blood pressure (BP) reduction.
AB  - METHODS: Using a cluster randomized design, 32 community health centers (CHCs) and district hospitals in Ghana will be randomized to either the intervention group (16 CHCs) or the control group (16 CHCs). A total of 640 patients with uncomplicated hypertension (BP 140-179/90-99 mm Hg and absence of target organ damage) will be enrolled in this study (20 patients per CHC). The intervention consists of WHO Package of CV risk assessment, patient education, initiation and titration of antihypertensive medications, behavioral counseling on lifestyle behaviors, and medication adherence every three months for 12 months. The primary outcome is the mean change in systolic BP from baseline to 12 months. The secondary outcomes are rates of BP control at 12 months; levels of physical activity, percent change in weight, and dietary intake of fruits and vegetables at 12 months; and sustainability of intervention effects at 24 months. All outcomes will be assessed at baseline, six months and 12 months. Trained community health nurses will deliver the intervention as part of Ghana's community-based health planning and services (CHPS) program.
AB  - DISCUSSION: Findings from this study will provide policy makers and other stakeholders needed information to recommend scalable and cost-effective policy with respect to comprehensive CV risk reduction and hypertension control in resource-poor settings.

TI  - CPAP versus oxygen in obstructive sleep apnea.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with hypertension, inflammation, and increased cardiovascular risk. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) reduces blood pressure, but adherence is often suboptimal, and the benefit beyond management of conventional risk factors is uncertain. Since intermittent hypoxemia may underlie cardiovascular sequelae of sleep apnea, we evaluated the effects of nocturnal supplemental oxygen and CPAP on markers of cardiovascular risk.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted a randomized, controlled trial in which patients with cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors were recruited from cardiology practices. Patients were screened for obstructive sleep apnea with the use of the Berlin questionnaire, and home sleep testing was used to establish the diagnosis. Participants with an apnea-hypopnea index of 15 to 50 events per hour were randomly assigned to receive education on sleep hygiene and healthy lifestyle alone (the control group) or, in addition to education, either CPAP or nocturnal supplemental oxygen. Cardiovascular risk was assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks of the study treatment. The primary outcome was 24-hour mean arterial pressure.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 318 patients who underwent randomization, 281 (88%) could be evaluated for ambulatory blood pressure at both baseline and follow-up. On average, the 24-hour mean arterial pressure at 12 weeks was lower in the group receiving CPAP than in the control group (-2.4 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], -4.7 to -0.1; P=0.04) or the group receiving supplemental oxygen (-2.8 mm Hg; 95% CI, -5.1 to -0.5; P=0.02). There was no significant difference in the 24-hour mean arterial pressure between the control group and the group receiving oxygen. A sensitivity analysis performed with the use of multiple imputation approaches to assess the effect of missing data did not change the results of the primary analysis.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In patients with cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors, the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea with CPAP, but not nocturnal supplemental oxygen, resulted in a significant reduction in blood pressure.

TI  - Youth-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus: lessons learned from the TODAY study.
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasingly diagnosed in obese children and adolescents. Evidence suggests that this disease commonly progresses more rapidly in youth compared with adults and is associated with high rates of early microalbuminuria, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) study was the first multiethnic, multicenter randomized trial in the United States to compare 3 treatment approaches in obese youth with new-onset type 2 diabetes (n=699; ages 10-17 years): monotherapy with metformin, metformin with rosiglitazone, and metformin with an intensive lifestyle intervention. The primary outcome was glycemic control. Diabetes-related complications and cardiovascular risk factors were also examined. Approximately half of the participants could not maintain glycemic control by using metformin alone. Combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone resulted in better durability of glycemic control, and metformin plus intensive lifestyle intervention was intermediate but not superior to metformin alone. Deterioration in glycemic control was associated with rapid loss of beta cell function, not worsened insulin sensitivity, and could not be explained by differences in adherence or body mass index. After 3.9 years, 236 (33.8%) of participants had hypertension and 116 participants (16.6%) had microalbuminuria. Only 55.9% of participants had a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level less than 100 mg/dL (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259) after 3 years, and 71 of 517 participants (13.7%) had retinopathy. The significance of the findings from this important trial for the management of youth and young adults with youth-onset type 2 diabetes and its complications is discussed. An aggressive multifaceted approach is needed to prevent or forestall premature microvascular and macrovascular complications in youth-onset type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Efficacy of a text messaging (SMS) based intervention for adults with hypertension: protocol for the StAR (SMS Text-message Adherence suppoRt trial) randomised controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interventions to support people with hypertension in attending clinics and taking their medication have potential to improve outcomes, but delivery on a wide scale and at low cost is challenging. Some trials evaluating clinical interventions using short message service (SMS) text-messaging systems have shown important outcomes, although evidence is limited. We have developed a novel SMS system integrated with clinical care for use by people with hypertension in a low-resource setting. We aim to test the efficacy of the system in improving blood pressure control and treatment adherence compared to usual care.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: The SMS Text-message Adherence suppoRt trial (StAR) is a pragmatic individually randomised three-arm parallel group trial in adults treated for hypertension at a single primary care centre in Cape Town, South Africa. The intervention is a structured programme of clinic appointment, medication pick-up reminders, medication adherence support and hypertension-related education delivered remotely using an automated system with either informational or interactive SMS text-messages. Usual care is supplemented by infrequent non-hypertension related SMS text-messages. Participants are 1:1:1 individually randomised, to usual care or to one of the two active interventions using minimisation to dynamically adjust for gender, age, baseline systolic blood pressure, years with hypertension, and previous clinic attendance. The primary outcome is the change in mean systolic blood pressure at 12-month follow-up from baseline measured with research staff blinded to trial allocation. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients with 80% or more of days medication available, proportion of participants achieving a systolic blood pressure less than 140 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg, hospital admissions, health status, retention in clinical care, satisfaction with treatment and care, and patient related quality of life. Anonymised demographic data are collected on non-participants.
AB  - DISCUSSION: The StAR trial uses a novel, low cost system based on widely available mobile phone technology to deliver the SMS-based intervention, manage communication with patients, and measure clinically relevant outcomes. The results will inform implementation and wider use of mobile phone based interventions for health care delivery in a low-resource setting.

TI  - The Cardiovascular Intervention Improvement Telemedicine Study (CITIES): rationale for a tailored behavioral and educational pharmacist-administered intervention for achieving cardiovascular disease risk reduction.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes are significant, but often preventable, contributors to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Medication and behavioral nonadherence are significant barriers to successful hypertension, hyperlidemia, and diabetes management. Our objective was to describe the theoretical framework underlying a tailored behavioral and educational pharmacist-administered intervention for achieving CVD risk reduction.
AB  - MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adults with poorly controlled hypertension and/or hyperlipidemia were enrolled from three outpatient primary care clinics associated with the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Durham, NC). Participants were randomly assigned to receive a pharmacist-administered, tailored, 1-year telephone-based intervention or usual care. The goal of the study was to reduce the risk for CVD through a theory-driven intervention to increase medication adherence and improve health behaviors.
AB  - RESULTS: Enrollment began in November 2011 and is ongoing. The target sample size is 500 patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The Cardiovascular Intervention Improvement Telemedicine Study (CITIES) intervention has been designed with a strong theoretical underpinning. The theoretical foundation and intervention are designed to encourage patients with multiple comorbidities and poorly controlled CVD risk factors to engage in home-based monitoring and tailored telephone-based interventions. Evidence suggests that clinical pharmacist-administered telephone-based interventions may be efficiently integrated into primary care for patients with poorly controlled CVD risk factors.

TI  - Implementation of the NHLBI integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: rationale and study design for young hearts, strong starts, a cluster-randomized trial targeting body mass index, blood pressure, and tobacco.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the underlying atherosclerosis begin in childhood, and their presence and intensity are related to known cardiovascular disease risk factors. Attention to risk factor control in childhood has the potential to reduce subsequent risk of CVD.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Young Hearts Strong Starts Study was designed to test strategies facilitating adoption of the National, Heart, Lung and Blood Institute supported Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction in Children and Adolescents. This study compares guideline-based quality measures for body mass index, blood pressure, and tobacco using two strategies: a multifaceted, practice-directed intervention versus standard dissemination.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Two primary care research networks recruited practices and provided support for the intervention and outcome evaluations. Individual practices were randomly assigned to the intervention or control groups using a cluster randomized design based on network affiliation, number of clinicians per practice, urban versus nonurban location, and practice type. The units of observation are individual children because measure adherence is abstracted from individual patient's medical records. The units of randomization are physician practices. This results in a multilevel design in which patients are nested within practices. The intervention practices received toolkits and supported guideline implementation including academic detailing, an ongoing e-learning group. This project is aligned with the American Board of Pediatrics Maintenance of Certification requirements including monthly physician self-abstraction, webinars, and other elements of the trial.
AB  - SIGNIFICANCE: This trial will provide an opportunity to demonstrate tools and strategies to enhance CV prevention in children by guideline-based interventions.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - EHR-based medication support and nurse-led medication therapy management: rationale and design for a three-arm clinic randomized trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic conditions often use complex medical regimens. A nurse-led strategy to support medication therapy management incorporated into primary care teams may lead to improved use of medications for disease control. Electronic health record (EHR) tools may offer a lower-cost, less intensive approach to improving medication management.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: The Northwestern and Access Community Health Network Medication Education Study is a health center-level cluster-randomized trial being conducted within a network of federally qualified community health centers. Health centers have been enrolled in groups of 3 and randomized to (1) usual care, (2) EHR-based medication management tools alone, or (3) EHR tools plus nurse-led medication therapy management. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension who are prescribed > 3 medications of any kind are recruited from the centers. EHR tools include a printed medication list to prompt review at each visit and automated plain-language medication information within the after-visit summary to encourage proper medication use. In the nurse-led intervention, patients receive one-on-one counseling about their medication regimens to clarify medication discrepancies and identify drug-related concerns, safety issues, and nonadherence. Nurses also provide follow-up telephone calls following new prescriptions and periodically to perform medication review. The primary study outcome is systolic blood pressure after 1 year. Secondary outcomes include measures of understanding of dosing instructions, discrepancies between patient-reported medications and the medical record, adherence, and intervention costs.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The Northwestern and Access Community Health Network Medication Education Study will assess the effects of 2 approaches to support outpatient medication management among patients with uncontrolled hypertension in federally qualified health center settings.

TI  - Improving refill adherence and hypertension control in black patients: Wisconsin TEAM trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness and sustainability of a 6-month Team Education and Adherence Monitoring (TEAM) intervention for black patients with hypertension in community chain pharmacies.
AB  - DESIGN: Cluster randomized trial.
AB  - SETTING: 28 chain pharmacies (14 TEAM and 14 control) in five Wisconsin cities from December 2006 to February 2009.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: 576 black patients with hypertension.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Trained pharmacist-technician teams implemented a 6-month intervention using scheduled visits, Brief Medication Questionnaires (BMQs), and novel toolkits for facilitating medication adherence and pharmacist feedback to patients and physicians. Control participants received patient information only.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Refill adherence (>80% days covered) and changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure, and blood pressure control using blinded assessments at 6 and 12 months.
AB  - RESULTS: At baseline, all patients had blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or more. Of those eligible, 79% activated the intervention (mean 4.25 visits). Compared with control participants at 6 months, TEAM participants achieved greater improvements in refill adherence (60% vs. 34%, P < 0.001), SBP (-12.62 vs. -5.31 mm Hg, P < 0.001), and blood pressure control (50% vs. 36%, P = 0.01). Six months after intervention discontinuation, TEAM participants showed sustained improvements in refill adherence ( P < 0.001) and SBP ( P = 0.004), though the difference in blood pressure control was not significant ( P < 0.05) compared with control participants. Analysis of intervention fidelity showed that patients who received the full intervention during months 1 through 6 achieved significantly greater 6- and 12-month improvements in refill adherence and blood pressure control compared with control participants.
AB  - CONCLUSION: A team-based intervention involving community chain pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and novel toolkits led to significant and sustained improvements in refill adherence and SBP in black patients with hypertension.

TI  - Effects of individual physician-level and practice-level financial incentives on hypertension care: a randomized trial.
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Pay for performance is intended to align incentives to promote high-quality care, but results have been contradictory.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the effect of explicit financial incentives to reward guideline-recommended hypertension care.
AB  - DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cluster randomized trial of 12 Veterans Affairs outpatient clinics with 5 performance periods and a 12-month washout that enrolled 83 primary care physicians and 42 nonphysician personnel (eg, nurses, pharmacists).
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Physician-level (individual) incentives, practice-level incentives, both, or none. Intervention participants received up to 5 payments every 4 months; all participants could access feedback reports.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Among a random sample, number of patients achieving guideline-recommended blood pressure thresholds or receiving an appropriate response to uncontrolled blood pressure, number of patients prescribed guideline-recommended medications, and number who developed hypotension.
AB  - RESULTS: Mean (SD) total payments over the study were $4270 ($459), $2672 ($153), and $1648 ($248) for the combined, individual, and practice-level interventions, respectively. The unadjusted baseline and final percentages and the adjusted absolute change over the study in patients meeting the combined blood pressure/appropriate response measure were 75% to 84% and 8.84% (95% CI, 4.20% to 11.80%) for the individual group, 80% to 85% and 3.70% (95% CI, 0.24% to 7.68%) for the practice-level group, 79% to 88% and 5.54% (95% CI, 1.92% to 9.52%) for the combined group, and 86% to 86% and 0.47% (95% CI, -3.12% to 4.04%) for the control group. The adjusted absolute estimated difference in the change between the proportion of patients with blood pressure control/appropriate response for individual incentive and control groups was 8.36% (95% CI, 2.40% to 13.00%; P=.005). The other incentive groups did not show a significant change compared with controls for this outcome. For medications, the unadjusted baseline and final percentages and the adjusted absolute change were 61% to 73% and 9.07% (95% CI, 4.52% to 13.44%), 56% to 65% and 4.98% (95% CI, 0.64% to 10.08%), 65% to 80% and 7.26% (95% CI, 2.92% to 12.48%), and 63% to 72% and 4.35% (95% CI, -0.28% to 9.28%), respectively. These changes in the use of guideline-recommended medications were not significant in any of the incentive groups compared with controls, nor was the incidence of hypotension. The effect of the incentive was not sustained after a washout.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Individual financial incentives, but not practice-level or combined incentives, resulted in greater blood pressure control or appropriate response to uncontrolled blood pressure; none of the incentives resulted in greater use of guideline-recommended medications or increased incidence of hypotension compared with controls. Further research is needed on the factors that contributed to these findings.

TI  - Effects of a web-based patient activation intervention to overcome clinical inertia on blood pressure control: cluster randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Only approximately half of patients with hypertension have their blood pressure controlled, due in large part to the tendency of primary care providers (PCPs) not to intensify treatment when blood pressure values are elevated.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study tested the effect of an intervention designed to help patients ask questions at the point of care to encourage PCPs to appropriately intensify blood pressure treatment.
AB  - METHODS: PCPs and their patients with hypertension (N=500) were recruited by letter and randomized into 2 study groups: (1) intervention condition in which patients used a fully automated website each month to receive tailored messages suggesting questions to ask their PCP to improve blood pressure control, and (2) control condition in which a similar tool suggested questions to ask about preventive services (eg, cancer screening). The Web-based tool was designed to be used during each of the 12 study months and before scheduled visits with PCPs. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients in both conditions with controlled blood pressure.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 500 enrolled patients (intervention condition: n=282; control condition: n=218), 418 (83.6%) completed the 12-month follow-up visit. At baseline, 289 (61.5%) of participants had controlled blood pressure. Most (411/500, 82.2%) participants used the intervention during at least 6 of 12 months and 222 (62.5%) reported asking questions directly from the Web-based tool. There were no group differences in asking about medication intensification and there were no differences in blood pressure control after 12 months between the intervention condition (201/282, 71.3%) and control condition (143/218, 65.6%; P=.27) groups. More intervention condition participants discussed having a creatinine test (92, 52.6% vs 49, 35.5%; P=.02) and urine protein test (81, 44.8% vs 21, 14.6%; P<.001), but no group differences were observed in the rate of testing. The control condition participants reported more frequent discussions about tetanus and pneumonia vaccines and reported more tetanus (30, 13.8% vs 15, 5.3%; P=.02) and pneumonia (25, 11.5% vs 16, 5.7%; P=.02) vaccinations after 12 months.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The use of an interactive website designed to overcome clinical inertia for hypertension care did not lead to improvements in blood pressure control. Participant adherence to the intervention was high. The control intervention led to positive changes in the use of preventive services (eg, tetanus immunization) and the intervention condition led to more discussions of hypertension-relevant tests (eg, serum creatinine and urine protein). By providing patients with individually tailored questions to ask during PCP visits, this study demonstrated that participants were likely to discuss the questions with PCPs. These discussions did not, however, lead to improvements in blood pressure control.

TI  - A double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial of varenicline for smokeless tobacco dependence in India.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The rate of smokeless tobacco use in India is 20%; its use causes serious health problems, and no trial has assessed behavioral or pharmacological treatments for this public health concern. This trial evaluated varenicline for treating smokeless tobacco dependence in India.
AB  - METHODS: This was a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial of varenicline (12 weeks, 1mg, twice per day) with 237 smokeless tobacco users in India. All participants received behavioral counseling. Outcomes included self-reported and biochemically verified abstinence at the end of treatment (EOT), lapse and recovery events, safety, and medication adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: Self-reported EOT abstinence was significantly greater for varenicline (43%) versus placebo (31%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.2-4.2, p = .009). Biochemically confirmed EOT abstinence was greater for varenicline versus placebo (25.2% vs. 19.5%), but this was not statistically different (AOR = 1.6, 95% CI = 0.84-3.1, p = .15). Compared with placebo, varenicline did not reduce the risk for a lapse (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.69-1.1, p = .14), but it did increase the likelihood of recovery to abstinence (HR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.02-1.4, p = .02). Greater adherence increased EOT cessation rates for varenicline (39% vs. 18%, p = .003) but not for placebo (28% vs. 14%, p = .06). There were no significant differences between varenicline and placebo in rate of side effects, serious adverse events, hypertension, or stopping or reducing medication.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Varenicline is safe for treating smokeless tobacco dependence in India, and further examination of this medication for this important public health problem is warranted.

TI  - Association of race consciousness with the patient-physician relationship, medication adherence, and blood pressure in urban primary care patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Race consciousness (the frequency with which one thinks about his or her own race) is a measure that may be useful in assessing whether racial discrimination negatively impacts blood pressure (BP). However, the relation between race consciousness and BP has yet to be empirically tested, especially within the context of the patient-physician relationship and medication adherence.
AB  - METHODS: Race-stratified generalized estimating equations were used to assess the relationship of race consciousness on BP, measures of the patient-physician relationship, and self-reported medication adherence, controlling for patients being nested within physicians and for patient age and sex.
AB  - RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 61.3 years, 62% were black, and 65% were women. Black patients were more likely to ever think about race than were white patients (49% vs. 21%; P < 0.001). Race-conscious blacks had significantly higher diastolic BP (79.4 vs. 74.5 mm Hg; P = 0.004) and somewhat higher systolic BP (138.8 vs. 134.7 mm Hg; P = 0.13) than blacks who were not race conscious. Race-conscious whites were more likely to perceive respect from their physician (57.1% vs. 25.8%; P = 0.01) but had lower medication adherence (62.4% vs. 82.9%; P = 0.05) than whites who were not race-conscious.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Among blacks, race consciousness was associated with higher diastolic BP. In contrast, among whites, there was no association between race consciousness and BP, but race consciousness was associated with poor ratings of adherence, despite more favorable ratings of the patient-physician relationship. Future work should explore disparities in race consciousness and its impact on health and health-care disparities.Copyright © American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd 2013. All rights reserved.

TI  - The impact of health literacy on desire for participation in healthcare, medical visit communication, and patient reported outcomes among patients with hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low health literacy (HL) is associated with poor healthcare outcomes; mechanisms for these associations remain unclear.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To elucidate how HL influences patients' interest in participating in healthcare, medical visit communication, and patient reported visit outcomes.
AB  - DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Cross-sectional study of enrollment data from a randomized controlled trial of interventions to improve patient adherence to hypertension treatments. Participants were 41 primary care physicians and 275 of their patients. Prior to the enrollment visit, physicians received a minimal intervention or communication skills training and patients received a minimal intervention or a pre-visit coaching session. This resulted in four intervention groups (minimal patient/minimal physician; minimal patient/intensive physician; intensive patient/minimal physician; and intensive patient/intensive physician).
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine; patients' desire for involvement in decision making; communication behaviors; patient ratings of participatory decision making (PDM), trust, and satisfaction.
AB  - RESULTS: A lower percentage of patients with low versus adequate literacy had controlled blood pressure. Both groups were similarly interested in participating in medical decision making. Communication behaviors did not differ based on HL except for medical question asking by patients, which was lower among low literacy patients. This was particularly true in the intensive patient /intensive physician group (3.85 vs. 6.42 questions; p = 0.002). Overall, ratings of care didn't differ based on HL; however, in analyses stratified by intervention assignment, patients with low literacy in minimal physician intervention groups reported significantly lower PDM scores than adequate literacy patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Patients with low and adequate literacy were similarly interested in participating in medical decision making. However, low literacy patients were less likely to experience PDM in their visits. Low literacy patients in the intensive physician intervention groups asked fewer medical questions. Patients with low literacy may be less able to respond to physicians' use of patient-centered communication approaches than adequate literacy patients.

TI  - Pilot trial of a licensed practical nurse intervention for hypertension and depression.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Depression is a risk factor for hypertension, and risk of depression is increased substantially in patients with hypertension. Our objective was to examine whether an intervention carried out by Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs) integrating depression treatment into care for hypertension improved blood pressure control and depressive symptoms.
AB  - METHODS: In all, 60 patients ages 41 to 92 years with hypertension and depressive symptoms at a large primary care practice in Philadelphia were randomly assigned to an integrated care intervention carried out by LPNs (n=30) or usual care (n=30). Intervention and control groups did not differ statistically on baseline measures. Outcomes assessed at baseline and 12 weeks included standard laboratory procedures to measure blood pressure control and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to assess depression.
AB  - RESULTS: Patients in the integrated care intervention had lower diastolic blood pressure (intervention 74.2 mmHg versus usual care 82.0 mmHg) and fewer depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 mean scores, intervention 2.4 versus usual care 7.1) compared with patients in the usual care group at 12 weeks after adjustment for baseline values. Patients in the integrated care intervention also had lower systolic blood pressure (intervention 130.0 mmHg versus usual care 140.6 mmHg) compared with patients in the usual care group at 12 weeks although the results approached but did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Training existing primary care practice office staff will facilitate implementation in real world practices with limited resources and competing demands.

TI  - Design of the Blood Pressure Goals in Dialysis pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is markedly increased among hemodialysis (HD) patients. Optimizing blood pressure (BP) among HD patients may present an important opportunity to reduce the disparity in CVD rates between HD patients and the general population. The optimal target predialysis systolic BP (SBP) among HD patients is unknown. Current international guidelines, calling for a predialysis SBP < 140 mm Hg, are based on the opinion and extrapolation from the general population. Existing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were small and did not include prespecified BP targets.
AB  - METHODS: The authors described the design of the Blood Pressure in Dialysis (BID) Study, a pilot, multicenter RCT where HD patients are randomized to either a target-standardized predialysis SBP of 110 to 140 mm Hg or 155 to 165 mm Hg. This is the first study to randomize HD patients to 2 different SBP targets.
AB  - RESULTS: Primary outcomes are feasibility and safety. Feasibility parameters include recruitment and retention rates, adherence with prescribed BP measurements and achievement and maintenance of selected BP targets. Safety parameters include rates of hypotension and other adverse and serious adverse events. The authors obtained preliminary data on changes in left ventricular mass, aortic pulse wave velocity, vascular access thromboses and health-related quality of life across study arms, which may be the secondary outcomes in the full-scale study.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The data acquired in the pilot RCT will determine the feasibility and safety and inform the design of a full-scale trial, powered for hard outcomes, which may require 2000 participants.

TI  - Financial incentives and physician commitment to guideline-recommended hypertension management.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the impact of financial incentives on physician goal commitment to guideline-recommended hypertension care.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Clinic-level cluster-randomized trial with 4 arms: individual, group, or combined incentives, and control.
AB  - METHODS: A total of 83 full-time primary care physicians at 12 Veterans Affairs medical centers completed web-based surveys measuring their goal commitment to guideline-recommended hypertension care every 4 months and telephone interviews at months 8 and 16. Intervention arm participants received performance-based incentives every 4 months for 5 periods. All participants received guideline education at baseline and audit and feedback every 4 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Physician goal commitment did not vary over time or across arms. Participants reported patient nonadherence was a perceived barrier and consistent follow-up was a perceived facilitator to successful hypertension care, suggesting that providers may perceive hypertension management as more of a patient responsibility (external locus of control).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Financial incentives may constitute an insufficiently strong intervention to influence goal commitment when providers attribute performance to external forces beyond their control.

TI  - The Nigerian antihypertensive adherence trial: a community-based randomized trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research in industrialized countries has demonstrated that a key factor limiting the control of hypertension is poor patient adherence and that the most successful interventions for long-term adherence employ multiple strategies. Very little data exist on this question in low-income countries, wherein medication-taking behavior may be less well developed.
AB  - METHOD: We conducted a treatment adherence trial of 544 patients [mean age ~63 years, mean blood pressure (BP) ~168/92 mmHg] with previously untreated hypertension in urban and rural Nigeria. Eligible participants were randomized to one of two arms: clinic management only, or clinic management and home visits. Both interventions included three elements: a community based, nurse-led treatment program with physician backup; facilitation of clinic visits and health education; and the use of diuretics and a beta blocker as needed. After initial diagnosis, the management protocol was implemented by a nurse with physician backup. Participants were evaluated monthly for 6 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Medication adherence was assessed with pill count and urine testing. Drop-out rates, by treatment group, ranged from 12 to 28%. Among participants who completed the 6-month trial, overall adherence was high (~77% of participants took >98% of prescribed pills). Adherence did not differ by treatment arm, but was better at the rural than the urban site and among those with higher baseline BP. Hypertension control (BP <140/90 mmHg) was achieved in approximately 66% of participants at 6 months.
AB  - CONCLUSION: This community-based intervention confirms relatively modest default rates compared with industrialized societies, and suggests that medication adherence can be high in developing world settings in clinic attenders.

TI  - The effect of enhanced depression care on adherence to risk-reducing behaviors after acute coronary syndromes: findings from the COPES trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The presence of depression after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is associated with worse prognosis and lower adherence to risk-reducing behaviors. We reported earlier that an enhanced depression care intervention reduces depression symptoms and major adverse cardiac events. This study evaluates the impact of the depression intervention on health behavior and blood pressure control.
AB  - METHODS: Between 2005 and 2008, 157 patients who remained persistently depressed 3 months after ACS were randomized to a 6-month depression intervention (initial patient preference for problem-solving therapy and/or pharmacotherapy, followed by stepped care; 80 patients) or to usual care (77 patients). At randomization, and then 2, 4, and 6 months later, patients were asked if they (1) missed taking their aspirin; (2) followed a heart healthy diet; (3) exercised regularly; and (4) used tobacco products. Blood pressure was measured before randomization and 6 months later.
AB  - RESULTS: At the end of the intervention, there was no significant improvement in the percentage of intervention compared to control group patients who adhered to aspirin (+3% versus -1%, P = .23), followed a healthy diet (+10% versus +8%, P = .39), exercised regularly (+5% versus +4%, P = .65), abstained from tobacco (-3% versus -1%, P = .77), or had controlled blood pressure (+6% versus +16%, P = .26).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Despite improving depression, enhanced depression care after an ACS did not improve health behavior or blood pressure control compared to usual care. Research is needed to test whether adding an adherence intervention to enhanced depression care can improve adherence and cardiovascular prognosis in depressed patients post-ACS.Copyright © 2012 Mosby, Inc.

TI  - Adherence to blood pressure telemonitoring in a cluster-randomized clinical trial.
AB  - Hypertension is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and death worldwide. Advances in technology have added telemedicine as a tool for managing hypertension. The effectiveness of telemedicine depends on patients' ability to adhere to schedules of home monitoring and case management. Participants with uncontrolled hypertension in the intervention arm of a randomized trial who completed 6 months of follow-up were included in this analysis. They were asked to measure their blood pressure (BP) a minimum of 6 times per week using a telemonitor that transmitted the readings to their pharmacist case manager. Hypertensive patients in this study had high adherence to telemonitoring (73% took at least 6 BP readings per week) and phone visits (88% of expected visits were attended). In a multivariate analysis, older age, male sex, and some college education predicted better telemonitoring adherence. White non-Hispanic race/ethnicity predicted better adherence to phone visits with pharmacist case managers. Telemonitoring adherence and phone adherence were highly correlated; participants who did not send readings on schedule were more likely to skip at least one phone visit with their pharmacist case manager. The findings from this analysis indicate that hypertensive patients in this study were able to achieve and maintain high adherence to both the telemonitoring and the phone case management visits.Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - A multifaceted prospective memory intervention to improve medication adherence: design of a randomized control trial.
AB  - Adherence to prescribed antihypertensive agents is critical because control of elevated blood pressure is the single most important way to prevent stroke and other end organ damage. Unfortunately, nonadherence remains a significant problem. Previous interventions designed to improve adherence have demonstrated only small benefits of strategies that target single facets such as understanding medication directions. The intervention described here is informed by prospective memory theory and performance of older adults in laboratory-based paradigms and uses a comprehensive, multifaceted approach to improve adherence. It incorporates multiple strategies designed to support key components of prospective remembering involved in taking medication. The intervention is delivered by nurses in the home with an education control group for comparison. Differences between groups in overall adherence following the intervention and 6 months later will be tested. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels also will be examined between groups and as they relate to adherence. Intra-individual regression is planned to examine change in adherence over time and its predictors. Finally, we will examine the association between executive function/working memory and adherence, predicting that adherence will be related to executive/working memory in the control group but not in the intervention group.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Determinants and consequences of adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension diet in African-American and white adults with high blood pressure: results from the ENCORE trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is an accepted nonpharmacologic treatment for hypertension, little is known about what patient characteristics affect dietary adherence and what level of adherence is needed to reduce blood pressure (BP).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine what factors predict dietary adherence and the extent to which dietary adherence is necessary to produce clinically meaningful BP reductions.
AB  - DESIGN: Ancillary study of the ENCORE (Exercise and Nutrition Interventions for Cardiovascular Health) trial--a 16-week randomized clinical trial of diet and exercise.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Participants included 144 sedentary, overweight, or obese adults (body mass index 25 to 39.9) with high BP (systolic 130 to 159 mm Hg and/or diastolic 85 to 99 mm Hg).
AB  - INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to one of three groups: DASH diet alone, DASH diet plus weight management, and Usual Diet Controls.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Our primary outcomes were a composite index of adherence to the DASH diet and clinic BP.
AB  - STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: General linear models were used to compare treatment groups on post-treatment adherence to the DASH diet. Linear regression was used to examine potential predictors of post-treatment DASH adherence. Analysis of covariance was used to examine the relation of adherence to the DASH diet and BP.
AB  - RESULTS: Participants in the DASH diet plus weight management (16.1 systolic BP [SBP]; 95% CI 13.0 to 19.2 mm Hg and 9.9 diastolic BP [DBP]; 95% CI 8.1 to 11.6 mm Hg) and DASH diet alone (11.2 SBP; 95% CI 8.1 to 14.3 mm Hg and 7.5 DBP; 95% CI 5.8 to 9.3 mm Hg) groups showed significant reductions in BP in comparison with Usual Diet Controls participants (3.4 SBP; 95% CI 0.4 to 6.4 mm Hg and DBP 3.8; 95% CI 2.2 to 5.5 mm Hg). Greater post-treatment consumption of DASH foods was noted in both the DASH diet alone (mean = 6.20; 95% CI 5.83 to 6.57) and DASH diet plus weight management groups (mean = 6.23; 95% CI 5.88 to 6.59) compared with Usual Diet Controls (mean = 3.66; 95% CI 3.30 to 4.01; P<0.0001), and greater adherence to the DASH diet was associated with larger reductions in clinic SBP and DBP (P < 0.01). Only ethnicity predicted dietary adherence, with African Americans less adherent to the DASH diet compared with whites (4.68; 95% CI 4.34 to 5.03 vs 5.83; 95% CI 5.50 to 6.11; P<0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Greater adherence to the DASH diet was associated with larger BP reductions independent of weight loss. African Americans were less likely to be adherent to the DASH dietary eating plan compared with whites, suggesting that culturally sensitive dietary strategies might be needed to improve adherence to the DASH diet.Copyright © 2012 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

TI  - Translating basic behavioral and social science research to clinical application: the EVOLVE mixed methods approach.[Erratum appears in J Consult Clin Psychol. 2013 Apr;81(2):230]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a mixed-methods approach to develop and test a basic behavioral science-informed intervention to motivate behavior change in 3 high-risk clinical populations. Our theoretically derived intervention comprised a combination of positive affect and self-affirmation (PA/SA), which we applied to 3 clinical chronic disease populations.
AB  - METHOD: We employed a sequential mixed methods model (EVOLVE) to design and test the PA/SA intervention in order to increase physical activity in people with coronary artery disease (post-percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]) or asthma (ASM) and to improve medication adherence in African Americans with hypertension (HTN). In an initial qualitative phase, we explored participant values and beliefs. We next pilot tested and refined the intervention and then conducted 3 randomized controlled trials with parallel study design. Participants were randomized to combined PA/SA versus an informational control and were followed bimonthly for 12 months, assessing for health behaviors and interval medical events.
AB  - RESULTS: Over 4.5 years, we enrolled 1,056 participants. Changes were sequentially made to the intervention during the qualitative and pilot phases. The 3 randomized controlled trials enrolled 242 participants who had undergone PCI, 258 with ASM, and 256 with HTN (n = 756). Overall, 45.1% of PA/SA participants versus 33.6% of informational control participants achieved successful behavior change (p = .001). In multivariate analysis, PA/SA intervention remained a significant predictor of achieving behavior change (p < .002, odds ratio = 1.66), 95% CI [1.22, 2.27], controlling for baseline negative affect, comorbidity, gender, race/ethnicity, medical events, smoking, and age.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The EVOLVE method is a means by which basic behavioral science research can be translated into efficacious interventions for chronic disease populations.

TI  - 'Decision support system (DSS) for prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among hypertensive (HTN) patients in Andhra Pradesh, India'--a cluster randomised community intervention trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Very few studies having decision support systems as an intervention report on patient outcomes for cardiovascular disease in the Western world. The potential role of decision support system for the management of blood pressure among Indian hypertensives remains unclear. We propose a cluster randomised trial that aims to test the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of DSS among Indian hypertensive patients.
AB  - METHODS: The trial design is a cluster randomised community intervention trial, in which the participants would be adult male and female hypertensive patients, in the age group of 35 to 64 years, reporting to the Primary Health Care centres of Mahabubnagar district, Andhra Pradesh, India. The objective of the study is to test the effectiveness and compare the cost effectiveness and cost utility among hypertensive subjects randomized to receive either decision support system or a chart based algorithmic support system in urban and rural areas of a district in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India (baseline versus 12 months follow up). The primary outcome would be a comparison of the systolic blood pressure at 0 and 12 months among hypertensive patients randomized to receive the decision support system or the chart based algorithmic support system. Computer generated randomisation and an investigator and analyser blinded method would be followed. 1600 participants; 800 to each arm; each arm having eight clusters of hundred participants each have been recruited between 01 August 2011 - 01 March 2012. A twelve month follow up will be completed by March 2013 and results are expected by April 2013.
AB  - DISCUSSION: This cluster randomized community intervention trial on DSS will enable policy makers to find out the effectiveness, cost effectiveness and cost utility of decision support system for management of blood pressure among hypertensive patients in India. Most of the previous studies on decision support system have focused on physician performance, adherence and on preventive care reminders. The uniqueness of the proposed study lies in finding out the effectiveness of a decision support system on patient related outcomes.

TI  - Improving blood pressure control through a clinical pharmacist outreach program in patients with diabetes mellitus in 2 high-performing health systems: the adherence and intensification of medications cluster randomized, controlled pragmatic trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Even in high-performing health systems, some patients with diabetes mellitus have poor blood pressure (BP) control because of poor medication adherence and lack of medication intensification. We examined whether the Adherence and Intensification of Medications intervention, a pharmacist-led intervention combining elements found in efficacy studies to lower BP, improved BP among patients with diabetes mellitus with persistent hypertension and poor refill adherence or insufficient medication intensification in 2 high-performing health systems.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a prospective, multisite cluster randomized pragmatic trial with randomization of 16 primary care teams at 5 medical centers (3 Veterans Affairs and 2 Kaiser Permanente) to the Adherence and Intensification of Medications intervention or usual care. The primary outcome was relative change in systolic BP (SBP), comparing 1797 intervention with 2303 control team patients, from 6 months preceding to 6 months after the 14-month intervention period. We examined shorter-term changes in SBP as a secondary outcome. The mean SBP decrease from 6 months before to 6 months after the intervention period was =9 mm Hg in both arms. Mean SBPs of eligible intervention patients were 2.4 mm Hg lower (95% CI: -3.4 to -1.5; P<0.001) immediately after the intervention than those achieved by control patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The Adherence and Intensification of Medications program more rapidly lowered SBPs among intervention patients, but usual-care patients achieved equally low SBP levels by 6 months after the intervention period. These findings show the importance of evaluating in different real-life clinical settings programs found in efficacy trials to be effective before urging their widespread adoption in all settings.

TI  - Predictors of lowering SBP to assigned targets at 12 months in the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lowering blood pressure for secondary stroke prevention remains a challenge. These analyses were conducted to identify factors predicting achievement of SBP targets in the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3) study.
AB  - METHODS: SPS3 is a randomized trial assigning patients with lacunar stroke to two targets of SBP control (130-149 mmHg or <130 mmHg). Logistic regression models were used to identify patient and SPS3 site characteristics predictive of lowering SBP to target at the 12-month study visit.
AB  - RESULTS: Of those above target at baseline (n = 1041), 69% were within their assigned target at 12 months. In the model with baseline characteristics only, those receiving treatment for hypertension at baseline were 68% less likely to achieve target [odds ratio (OR) = 0.32; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.17-0.60], whereas those of Hispanic ethnicity were 1.49 times more likely (95% CI = 1.09-2.03) to achieve SBP target. When clinical site characteristics were added to the model, only treated hypertension at baseline remained significant. In addition, management at a larger site (OR = 1.51; 95% CI = 1.03-2.20), SBP in target at 6 months (OR = 2.39; 95% CI = 1.79-3.19), and medication adherence (OR = 2.73; 95% CI = 1.51-4.95) were positively associated with achieving target SBP. Missed appointments (OR = 0.55; 95% CI = 0.41-0.73) were negatively associated with lowering SBP to target at 12 months.
AB  - CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that it is feasible to achieve targets of SBP control in this multiethnic stroke cohort across multiple sites and countries. The results highlight the important variables reflecting clinical site management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: TODAY (Treatment Options for type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth) is a federally funded multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing three treatments of youth onset type 2 diabetes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the experience of youth participating in a 2-6 month run-in period in preparation for randomization into TODAY.
AB  - SUBJECTS: An ethnically diverse sample of 927 youth, 65.4% females, aged 13.7 +/- 2.0 yr old, with type 2 diabetes for a median of 2 months (0.7-7.8 months, 25th-75th percentiles).
AB  - METHODS: A run-in period was conducted to achieve HbA1c <8% with metformin monotherapy and diabetes education, and to evaluate adherence to pill taking, visit attendance, and other procedures.
AB  - RESULTS: At entry, mean body mass index (BMI) and z-BMI were 35.6 +/- 7.7 and 2.3 +/- 0.4, respectively, mean HbA1c was 7.7 +/- 2.2%, only 42.5% were on a hypoglycemic treatment, and 35.6% had HbA1c >8%. Comorbid conditions were common; 18.8% had hypertension, 24.2% had elevated cholesterol, and 6.5% had abnormal liver enzymes. After a median 71 d of run-in, 90.9% had HbA1c <8%, 77.9% had HbA1c <7%, and 46.4% had HbA1c <6%. Of the 772 youth achieving the target HbA1c <8%, 704 (91.2%) were randomized; non-adherence to metformin treatment was the main cause for non-randomization. Youth proceeding to randomization decreased weight by 0.68kg and HbA1c by 1.45% compared to a weight gain of 0.71kg and HbA1c decrease of 0.74% in the non-randomized youth (p = 0.01 in both cases). However, change in z-BMI was not significantly different between the two groups.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Most youth with recent onset type 2 diabetes can achieve target HbA1c <8.0% with short-term metformin monotherapy and standard diabetes education (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00081328).Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

TI  - The effect of patient-provider communication on medication adherence in hypertensive black patients: does race concordance matter?.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite evidence of a positive effect of collaborative patient-provider communication on patient outcomes, our understanding of this relationship is unclear.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to determine whether racial composition of the relationship modified the association between ratings of provider communication and medication adherence.
AB  - METHODS: Effect modification of the communication-adherence association, by racial composition of the relationship, was evaluated using general linear mixed models while adjusting for selected covariates.
AB  - RESULTS: Three hundred ninety patients were in race-concordant (black patient, black provider) relationships, while 207 were in race-discordant (black patient, white provider) relationships. The communication-adherence association was significantly modified in race-discordant relationships (p = 0.04). Communication rated as more collaborative in race-discordant relationships was associated with better adherence, while communication rated as less collaborative was associated with poor adherence. There was no significant association between adherence and communication in race-concordant relationships (p = 0.24).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Collaborative patient-provider communication may play an influential role in black patients' adherence behaviors when receiving care from white providers.

TI  - Increasing physical activity in patients with asthma through positive affect and self-affirmation: a randomized trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with asthma engage in less physical activity than peers without asthma. Protocols are needed to prudently increase physical activity in asthma patients. We evaluated whether an educational intervention enhanced with positive-affect induction and self-affirmation was more effective than the educational protocol alone in increasing physical activity in asthma patients.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial in New York City from September 28, 2004, through July 5, 2007; of 258 asthma patients, 252 completed the trial. At enrollment, control subjects completed a survey measuring energy expenditure, made a contract to increase physical activity, received a pedometer and an asthma workbook, and then underwent bimonthly follow-up telephone calls. Intervention patients received this protocol plus small gifts and instructions in fostering positive affect and self-affirmation. The main outcome was the within-patient change in energy expenditure in kilocalories per week from enrollment to 12 months with an intent-to-treat analysis.
AB  - RESULTS: Mean (SD) energy expenditure at enrollment was 1767 (1686) kcal/wk among controls and 1860 (1633) kcal/wk among intervention patients (P = .65) and increased by 415 (95% CI, 76-754; P = .02) and 398 (95% CI, 145-652; P = .002) kcal/wk, respectively, with no difference between groups (P = .94). For both groups, energy expenditure was sustained through 12 months. No adverse events were attributed to the trial. In multivariate analysis, increased energy expenditure was associated with less social support, decreased depressive symptoms, more follow-up calls, use of the pedometer, fulfillment of the contract, and the intervention among patients who required urgent asthma care (all P < .10, 2-sided test).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A multiple-component protocol was effective in increasing physical activity in asthma patients, but an intervention to increase positive affect and self-affirmation was not effective within this protocol. The intervention may have had some benefit, however, in the subgroup of patients who required urgent asthma care during the trial. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00195117.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of positive-affect intervention and medication adherence in hypertensive African Americans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor adherence explains poor blood pressure (BP) control; however African Americans suffer worse hypertension-related outcomes.
AB  - METHODS: This randomized controlled trial evaluated whether a patient education intervention enhanced with positive-affect induction and self-affirmation (PA) was more effective than patient education (PE) alone in improving medication adherence and BP reduction among 256 hypertensive African Americans followed up in 2 primary care practices. Patients in both groups received a culturally tailored hypertension self-management workbook, a behavioral contract, and bimonthly telephone calls designed to help them overcome barriers to medication adherence. Also, patients in the PA group received small gifts and bimonthly telephone calls to help them incorporate positive thoughts into their daily routine and foster self-affirmation. The main outcome measures were medication adherence (assessed with electronic pill monitors) and within-patient change in BP from baseline to 12 months.
AB  - RESULTS: The baseline characteristics were similar in both groups: the mean BP was 137/82 mm Hg; 36% of the patients had diabetes; 11% had stroke; and 3% had chronic kidney disease. Based on the intention-to-treat principle, medication adherence at 12 months was higher in the PA group than in the PE group (42% vs 36%, respectively; P =.049). The within-group reduction in systolic BP (2.14 mm Hg vs 2.18 mm Hg; P = .98) and diastolic BP (-1.59 mm Hg vs -0.78 mm Hg; P = .45) for the PA group and PE group, respectively, was not significant.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A PE intervention enhanced with PA led to significantly higher medication adherence compared with PE alone in hypertensive African Americans. Future studies should assess the cost-effectiveness of integrating such interventions into primary care. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00227175.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of positive-affect induction to promote physical activity after percutaneous coronary intervention.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Within 1 year after percutaneous coronary intervention, more than 20% of patients experience new adverse events. Physical activity confers a 25% reduction in mortality; however, physical activity is widely underused. Thus, there is a need for more powerful behavioral interventions to promote physical activity. Our objective was to motivate patients to achieve an increase in expenditure of 336 kcal/wk or more at 12 months as assessed by the Paffenbarger Physical Activity and Exercise Index.
AB  - METHODS: Two hundred forty-two patients were recruited immediately after percutaneous coronary intervention between October 2004 and October 2006. Patients were randomized to 1 of 2 groups. The patient education (PE) control group (n = 118) (1) received an educational workbook, (2) received a pedometer, and (3) set a behavioral contract for a physical activity goal. The positive-affect/self-affirmation (PA) intervention group (n = 124) received the 3 PE control components plus (1) a PA workbook chapter, (2) bimonthly induction of PA by telephone, and (3) small mailed gifts. All patients were contacted with standardized bimonthly telephone follow-up for 12 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Attrition was 4.5%, and 2.1% of patients died. Significantly more patients in the PA intervention group increased expenditure by 336 kcal/wk or more at 12 months, our main outcome, compared with the PE control group (54.9% vs 37.4%, P = .007). The PA intervention patients were 1.7 times more likely to reach the goal of a 336-kcal/wk or more increase by 12 months, controlling for demographic and psychosocial measures. In multivariate analysis, the PA intervention patients had nearly double the improvement in kilocalories per week at 12 months compared with the PE control patients (602 vs 328, P = .03).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Patients who receive PA intervention after percutaneous coronary intervention are able to achieve a sustained and clinically significant increase in physical activity by 12 months. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00248846.

TI  - Comparison of associations of adherence to a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style diet with risks of cardiovascular disease and venous thromboembolism.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) share some risk factors, including obesity, but it is unclear how dietary patterns associated with reduced risk of CVD relate to risk of VTE.
AB  - OBJECTIVE:  To compare the relationships of adherence to a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style diet with the risks of CVD and VTE.
AB  - PATIENTS/METHODS: We confirmed by medical record review 1094 incident cases of CVD and 675 incident VTEs during a mean follow-up of 14.6 years in 34 827 initially healthy participants in the Women's Health Study who completed at baseline a 133-item food frequency questionnaire scored for adherence to a DASH diet. We compared estimated associations of dietary patterns with CVD and VTE from proportional hazards models in a competing risk framework.
AB  - RESULTS: Initial analyses adjusted for age, energy intake and randomized treatments showed 36-41% reduced hazards of CVD among women in the top two quintiles of DASH score relative to those in the bottom quintile (P(trend) < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, women in the top two quintiles had 12-23% reduced hazards of CVD relative to women in the bottom quintile (P(trend) = 0.04). Analyses restricted to coronary events showed more variable 10-33% reduced hazards in the top two quintiles (P(trend) = 0.09). In contrast, higher DASH scores were unrelated to risk of VTE, with a 1% reduced hazard for the top vs. bottom quintile (P(trend) = 0.95).
AB  - CONCLUSION: An apparently strong association of adherence to the DASH diet with incidence of CVD was attenuated upon control for confounding variables. Adherence to the DASH diet was not associated with risk of VTE in women.Copyright © 2011 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.

TI  - Effect of a physician uncertainty reduction intervention on blood pressure in uncontrolled hypertensives--a cluster randomized trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical inertia, provider failure to appropriately intensify treatment, is a major contributor to uncontrolled blood pressure (BP). Some clinical inertia may result from physician uncertainty over the patient's usual BP, adherence, or value of continuing efforts to control BP through lifestyle changes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that providing physicians with uncertainty reduction tools, including 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, electronic bottle cap monitoring, and lifestyle assessment and counseling, will lead to improved BP control.
AB  - DESIGN: Cluster randomized trial with five intervention clinics (IC) and five usual care clinics (UCC).
AB  - SETTING: Six public and 4 private primary care clinics.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: A total of 665 patients (63 percent African American) with uncontrolled hypertension (BP >140 mmHg/90 mmHg or >130/80 mmHg if diabetic).
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: An order form for uncertainty reduction tools was placed in the IC participants' charts before each visit and results fed back to the provider.
AB  - OUTCOME MEASURES: Percent with controlled BP at last visit. Secondary outcome was BP changes from baseline.
AB  - RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 24 months. IC physicians intensified treatment in 81% of IC patients compared to 67% in UCC (p<0.001); 35.0% of IC patients and 31.9% of UCC patients achieved control at the last recorded visit (p>0.05). Multi-level mixed effects longitudinal regression modeling of SBP and DBP indicated a significant, non-linear slope difference favoring IC (p (time x group interaction)=0.048 for SBP and p=0.001 for DBP). The model-predicted difference attributable to intervention was -2.8 mmHg for both SBP and DBP by month 24, and -6.5 mmHg for both SBP and DBP by month 36.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The uncertainty reduction intervention did not achieve the pre-specified dichotomous outcome, but led to lower measured BP in IC patients.

TI  - Combination therapy as initial treatment for newly diagnosed hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommends that clinicians consider the use of multidrug therapy to increase likelihood of achieving blood pressure goal. Little is known about recent patterns of combination antihypertensive therapy use in patients being initiated on hypertension treatment.
AB  - METHODS: We investigated combination antihypertensive therapy use in newly diagnosed hypertensive patients from the Cardiovascular Research Network Hypertension Registry. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between combination antihypertensive therapy and 12-month blood pressure control.
AB  - RESULTS: Between 2002 and 2007, a total of 161,585 patients met criteria for incident hypertension and were initiated on treatment. During the study period, an increasing proportion of patients were treated initially with combination rather than with single-agent therapy (20.7% in 2002 compared with 35.8% in 2007, P < .001). This increase in combination therapy use was more pronounced in patients with stage 2 hypertension, whose combination therapy use increased from 21.6% in 2002 to 44.5% in 2007. Nearly 90% of initial combination therapy was accounted for by 2 combinations, a thiazide and a potassium-sparing diuretic (47.6%) and a thiazide and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (41.4%). After controlling for relevant clinical factors, including subsequent intensification of treatment and medication adherence, combination therapy was associated with increased odds of blood pressure control at 12 months (odds ratio compared with single-drug initial therapy 1.20; 95% CI 1.15-1.24, P < .001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Initial treatment of hypertension with combination therapy is increasingly common and is associated with better long-term blood pressure control.Copyright © 2011 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - A randomized trial to improve patient-centered care and hypertension control in underserved primary care patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: African Americans and persons with low socioeconomic status (SES) are disproportionately affected by hypertension and receive less patient-centered care than less vulnerable patient populations. Moreover, continuing medical education (CME) and patient-activation interventions have infrequently been directed to improve the processes of care for these populations.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of patient-centered interventions targeting patients and physicians with the effectiveness of minimal interventions for underserved groups.
AB  - DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial conducted from January 2002 through August 2005, with patient follow-up at 3 and 12 months, in 14 urban, community-based practices in Baltimore, Maryland.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Forty-one primary care physicians and 279 hypertension patients.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Physician communication skills training and patient coaching by community health workers.
AB  - MAIN MEASURES: Physician communication behaviors; patient ratings of physicians' participatory decision-making (PDM), patient involvement in care (PIC), reported adherence to medications; systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) and BP control.
AB  - KEY RESULTS: Visits of trained versus control group physicians demonstrated more positive communication change scores from baseline (-0.52 vs. -0.82, p = 0.04). At 12 months, the patient+physician intensive group compared to the minimal intervention group showed significantly greater improvements in patient report of physicians' PDM (beta = +6.20 vs. -5.24, p = 0.03) and PIC dimensions related to doctor facilitation (beta = +0.22 vs. -0.17, p = 0.03) and information exchange (beta = +0.32 vs. -0.22, p = 0.005). Improvements in patient adherence and BP control did not differ across groups for the overall patient sample. However, among patients with uncontrolled hypertension at baseline, non-significant reductions in systolic BP were observed among patients in all intervention groups-the patient+physician intensive (-13.2 mmHg), physician intensive/patient minimal (-10.6 mmHg), and the patient intensive/physician minimal (-16.8 mmHg), compared to the patient+physician minimal group (-2.0 mmHg).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Interventions that enhance physicians' communication skills and activate patients to participate in their care positively affect patient-centered communication, patient perceptions of engagement in care, and may improve systolic BP among urban African-American and low SES patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

TI  - Limitations of analyses based on achieved blood pressure: lessons from the African American study of kidney disease and hypertension trial.
AB  - Blood pressure (BP) guidelines that set target BP levels often rely on analyses of achieved BP from hypertension treatment trials. The objective of this article was to compare the results of analyses of achieved BP to intention-to-treat analyses on renal disease progression. Participants (n=1094) in the African-American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension Trial were randomly assigned to either usual BP goal defined by a mean arterial pressure goal of 102 to 107 mm Hg or lower BP goal defined by a mean arterial pressure goal of <92 mm Hg. Median follow-up was 3.7 years. Primary outcomes were rate of decline in measured glomerular filtration rate and a composite of a decrease in glomerular filtration rate by >50% or >25 mL/min per 1.73 m(2), requirement for dialysis, transplantation, or death. Intention-to-treat analyses showed no evidence of a BP effect on either the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate or the clinical composite outcome. In contrast, the achieved BP analyses showed that each 10-mm Hg increment in mean follow-up achieved mean arterial pressure was associated with a 0.35 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) (95% CI: 0.08 to 0.62 mL/min per 1.73 m(2); P=0.01) faster mean glomerular filtration rate decline and a 17% (95% CI: 5% to 32%; P=0.006) increased risk of the clinical composite outcome. Analyses based on achieved BP lead to markedly different inferences than traditional intention-to-treat analyses, attributed in part to confounding of achieved BP with comorbidities, disease severity, and adherence. Clinicians and policy makers should exercise caution when making treatment recommendations based on analyses relating outcomes to achieved BP.

TI  - Randomized, controlled trial of an intervention to enable stroke survivors throughout the Los Angeles County safety net to "stay with the guidelines".
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability. Inpatient programs optimize secondary stroke prevention care at the time of hospital discharge, but such care may not be continued after hospital discharge.
AB  - METHODS: To improve the delivery of secondary stroke preventive services after hospital discharge, we have designed a chronic care model-based program called SUSTAIN (Systemic Use of STroke Averting INterventions). This care intervention includes group clinics, self-management support, report cards, decision support through care guides and protocols, and coordination of ongoing care. The first specific aim is to test, in a randomized, controlled trial, whether SUSTAIN improves blood pressure control among an analytic sample of 268 patients with a recent stroke or transient ischemic attack discharged from 4 Los Angeles County public hospitals. Secondary outcomes consist of control of other stroke risk factors, lifestyle habits, medication adherence, patient perceptions of care quality, functional status, and quality of life. A second specific aim is to conduct a cost analysis of SUSTAIN from the perspective of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services by using direct costs of the intervention, cost equivalents of associated utilization of county system resources, and cost equivalents of the observed and predicted averted vascular events.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: If SUSTAIN is effective, we will have the expertise and findings to advocate for its continued support at Los Angeles County hospitals and to disseminate the SUSTAIN program to other settings serving indigent, minority populations.

TI  - Study protocol: the Adherence and Intensification of Medications (AIM) study--a cluster randomized controlled effectiveness study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients with diabetes have poor blood pressure (BP) control. Pharmacological therapy is the cornerstone of effective BP treatment, yet there are high rates both of poor medication adherence and failure to intensify medications. Successful medication management requires an effective partnership between providers who initiate and increase doses of effective medications and patients who adhere to the regimen.
AB  - METHODS: In this cluster-randomized controlled effectiveness study, primary care teams within sites were randomized to a program led by a clinical pharmacist trained in motivational interviewing-based behavioral counseling approaches and authorized to make BP medication changes or to usual care. This study involved the collection of data during a 14-month intervention period in three Department of Veterans Affairs facilities and two Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities. The clinical pharmacist was supported by clinical information systems that enabled proactive identification of, and outreach to, eligible patients identified on the basis of poor BP control and either medication refill gaps or lack of recent medication intensification. The primary outcome is the relative change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) measurements over time. Secondary outcomes are changes in Hemoglobin A1c, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), medication adherence determined from pharmacy refill data, and medication intensification rates.
AB  - DISCUSSION: Integration of the three intervention elements--proactive identification, adherence counseling and medication intensification--is essential to achieve optimal levels of control for high-risk patients. Testing the effectiveness of this intervention at the team level allows us to study the program as it would typically be implemented within a clinic setting, including how it integrates with other elements of care.

TI  - Rationale and design of a randomized trial to evaluate an evidence-based prescription drug label on actual medication use.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication errors are an important public health concern, and poor understanding of medication labels are a root cause. Research shows that labels are variable, of poor quality, and not patient-centered. No real-world trials have evaluated whether improved medication labels can affect appropriate medication use, adherence or health outcomes.
AB  - TRIAL DESIGN: We developed an evidence-based prescription label that addresses both content and format. The enhanced label includes a universal medication schedule (UMS) that standardizes the directions for use incorporating 1) standard time periods for administration (morning, noon, evening, and bedtime), 2) numeric vs. alpha characters, 3) 'carriage returns' to separate daily dose and 4) a graphic aid to visually depict dose and frequency. We will evaluate the effect of providing this label to randomly sampled patients who receive their care from free clinics, mobile vans and federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) in Northern Virginia. We will recruit patients with diabetes or hypertension; these patients will be randomly assigned to receive all of their medications with improved labels or to receive prescriptions with standard labels. The primary outcome will be the patient's ability to correctly demonstrate dosing instructions. Other outcomes include adherence, error rates and health outcomes.
AB  - CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this trial is the first to evaluate the effect of prescription label improvement on understanding, medication use and outcomes in a clinical setting. If successful, these findings could be implemented broadly to promote safe and appropriate medication use and to support evidence-based standards in the development of labels.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Effect of self-efficacy and social support on adherence to antihypertensive drugs.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between poor adherence and self-efficacy or social support after a pharmacist intervention.
AB  - DESIGN: Post-hoc analysis of data from two randomized controlled trials of physician-pharmacist collaborative interventions (6 and 9 mo, respectively) to improve blood pressure control.
AB  - SETTING: Eleven university-affiliated primary care clinics.
AB  - PATIENTS: Five hundred eighty-four patients (aged 21-85 yrs) with uncontrolled primary hypertension; 296 were in the intervention group and 288 were in the control group.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Pharmacists provided intensified hypertension management and drug adherence counseling to patients in the intervention group.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Social support and self-efficacy questionnaires were administered at baseline and end-of-study visits. Patient adherence was monitored by using the Morisky self-reported adherence questionnaire. Self-reported adherence scores improved significantly in the control group (p=0.0053) but not in the intervention group; however, adherence at baseline in both groups was high. There were small, but significant, improvements in self-efficacy (p<0.04) and social support (p<0.05) scores in the intervention group but not the control group at the end of the study. Social support and, to a lesser extent, self-efficacy improved as a function of duration of study participation (9-mo vs 6-mo intervention), regardless of whether the patient received the intervention. Blood pressure control in both groups improved significantly at the end of the study; however, mean blood pressure was significantly lower in the intervention group (129.7/76.6 mm Hg) compared with the control group (140.8/78.9 mm Hg; p<0.0001 for systolic, p=0.032 for diastolic).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Social support and self-efficacy improved significantly in the intervention group at the end of the pharmacist intervention. Drug adherence was correlated with self-efficacy even though drug adherence did not improve significantly in the intervention group. The fact that social support and self-efficacy improved as a function of duration of study participation suggests that participation in a research study may have had a positive influence on these measures. Even though the changes in social support, self-efficacy, and drug adherence were modest, there was significantly better blood pressure control in the intervention group compared with the control group. These findings indicate that changes in drug adherence, self-efficacy, or social support probably played a minor role in the blood pressure outcomes in these studies.

TI  - Vitamins C and E to prevent complications of pregnancy-associated hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress has been proposed as a mechanism linking the poor placental perfusion characteristic of preeclampsia with the clinical manifestations of the disorder. We assessed the effects of antioxidant supplementation with vitamins C and E, initiated early in pregnancy, on the risk of serious adverse maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes related to pregnancy-associated hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial involving nulliparous women who were at low risk for preeclampsia. Women were randomly assigned to begin daily supplementation with 1000 mg of vitamin C and 400 IU of vitamin E or matching placebo between the 9th and 16th weeks of pregnancy. The primary outcome was severe pregnancy-associated hypertension alone or severe or mild hypertension with elevated liver-enzyme levels, thrombocytopenia, elevated serum creatinine levels, eclamptic seizure, medically indicated preterm birth, fetal-growth restriction, or perinatal death.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 10,154 women underwent randomization. The two groups were similar with respect to baseline characteristics and adherence to the study drug. Outcome data were available for 9969 women. There was no significant difference between the vitamin and placebo groups in the rates of the primary outcome (6.1% and 5.7%, respectively; relative risk in the vitamin group, 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91 to 1.25) or in the rates of preeclampsia (7.2% and 6.7%, respectively; relative risk, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.24). Rates of adverse perinatal outcomes did not differ significantly between the groups.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin C and E supplementation initiated in the 9th to 16th week of pregnancy in an unselected cohort of low-risk, nulliparous women did not reduce the rate of adverse maternal or perinatal outcomes related to pregnancy-associated hypertension (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00135707).Copyright 2010 Massachusetts Medical Society

TI  - Deterioration of blood pressure control after discontinuation of a physician-pharmacist collaborative intervention.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess blood pressure control after discontinuation of a physician-pharmacist collaborative intervention.
AB  - DESIGN: Comparative analysis of data of the patients who received the intervention versus a control group from a prospective, cluster-randomized, 9-month efficacy trial and the same patients' data 18 and 27 months after completion of the trial, abstracted from their medical records.
AB  - SETTING: Five primary care medical offices operated by a university health system.
AB  - PATIENTS: One hundred four patients with hypertension; 65 were in the intervention group, and 39 were in the control group.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the prospective study, patients were randomized to receive a physician-pharmacist collaborative intervention to improve blood pressure control or to the control group. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured by a research nurse at baseline and at the end of the study (9 mo later). In the current study, data were abstracted for blood pressure and blood pressure control at 18 and 27 months (9 and 18 mo, respectively, after discontinuation of the study). At baseline, mean +/- SD systolic blood pressure was 152.5 +/- 9.5 and 150.1 +/- 9.6 mm Hg in the intervention and control groups, respectively (p=0.22). At 9 months, systolic blood pressure decreased to 124.5 +/- 10.7 and 132.0 +/- 15.1 mm Hg (p=0.0038 between groups), and blood pressure was controlled in 78.5% and 48.7% (p=0.0017) of patients in the intervention and control groups, respectively. By 18 months, systolic blood pressure had deteriorated to 131.0 +/- 12.2 and 143.3 +/- 17.5 mm Hg (p<0.001), and blood pressure control rates decreased to 53.9% and 30.8% (p=0.02). By 27 months, systolic blood pressure was 131.3 +/- 13.0 and 141.2 +/- 15.8 mm Hg (p=0.0008), and blood pressure control was 55.4% and 35.9% (p=0.05).
AB  - CONCLUSION: A sustained positive effect on blood pressure control was noted up to 18 months after discontinuation of a physician-pharmacist collaborative intervention, when compared with a control group. Blood pressure control did deteriorate at a similar rate in both the intervention and control groups, but the percentage of patients with controlled blood pressure remained significantly higher in the intervention group. These results suggest that continued interventions by pharmacists may be necessary to maintain high rates of blood pressure control, especially in those patients whose blood pressure begins to increase.

TI  - Physician and pharmacist collaboration to improve blood pressure control.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have demonstrated that blood pressure (BP) control can be improved when clinical pharmacists assist with patient management. The objective of this study was to evaluate if a physician and pharmacist collaborative model in community-based medical offices could improve BP control.
AB  - METHODS: This was a prospective, cluster randomized, controlled clinical trial with clinics randomized to a control group (n = 3) or to an intervention group (n = 3). The study enrolled 402 patients (mean age, 58.3 years) with uncontrolled hypertension. Clinical pharmacists made drug therapy recommendations to physicians based on national guidelines. Research nurses performed BP measurements and 24-hour BP monitoring.
AB  - RESULTS: The mean (SD) guideline adherence scores increased from 49.4 (19.3) at baseline to 53.4 (18.1) at 6 months (8.1% increase) in the control group and from 40.4 (22.6) at baseline to 62.8 (13.5) at 6 months (55.4% increase) in the intervention group (P = .09 for adjusted between-group comparison). The mean BP decreased 6.8/4.5 mm Hg in the control group and 20.7/9.7 mm Hg in the intervention group (P < .05 for between-group systolic BP comparison). The adjusted difference in systolic BP was -12.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], -24.0 to 0.0) mm Hg, while the adjusted difference in diastolic BP was -1.8 (95% CI, -11.9 to 8.3) mm Hg. The 24-hour BP levels showed similar effect sizes. Blood pressure was controlled in 29.9% of patients in the control group and in 63.9% of patients in the intervention group (adjusted odds ratio, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.0-5.1; P < .001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A physician and pharmacist collaborative intervention achieved significantly better mean BP and overall BP control rates compared with a control group. Additional research should be conducted to evaluate efficient strategies to implement team-based chronic disease management.

TI  - Are co-morbidities associated with guideline adherence? The MI-Plus study of Medicare patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The impact of co-morbid illnesses on adherence to guideline recommendations in chronic illness is of growing concern. We tested a framework [Piette and Kerr, Diabetes Care. 29(3):725-31, 2006] of provider adherence to guidelines in the presence of co-morbid conditions, which suggests that the effect of co-morbid conditions depends on treatment recommendations for the co-morbid conditions and how symptomatic they are.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted an exploratory analysis to assess the framework using chart audit data for 1,240 post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI) Medicare beneficiaries in Alabama. We assessed level of guideline-adherent post-AMI care from chart-based quality indicators and constructed scores reflecting how much care for the co-morbid condition was similar to post-AMI care (concordance) and how symptomatic the co-morbid condition is, based on expert opinion.
AB  - RESULTS: Patients had a mean age of 74 years, mean co-morbidities of 2, and 61% were white. Both concordance and symptomatic scores were positively associated with guideline compliance, with correlations of 0.32 and 0.14, respectively (p < 0.001 for each). We found positive correlations between highly concordant co-morbid conditions and post-AMI quality scores and negative correlations between highly symptomatic conditions and post-AMI quality scores; both findings support the framework. However, the framework performed less well for conditions that were not highly concordant or highly symptomatic, and the magnitudes of the associations were not large.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The framework was related to the association of co-morbid conditions with adherence by providers to guideline-recommended treatment for post-AMI patients. The framework holds promise for evaluating and possibly predicting guideline adherence.

TI  - Perceived susceptibility to chronic kidney disease among high-risk patients seen in primary care practices.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients' views of their risk for the development or progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are poorly characterized.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess perceived risk and concern regarding CKD development or progression among high-risk patients seen in primary care, identify predictors of perceptions, and correlate perceptions with adherence to high blood pressure management.
AB  - DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study of 195 patients enrolled in a randomized controlled trial on hypertension management in 40 Maryland primary care practices.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: We assessed independent predictors (sociodemographics, health literacy, clinical presence of CKD, co-morbid conditions, and health behaviors) of perceived susceptibility (assessed via questionnaire) and adherence (assessed via Hill-Bone blood pressure adherence scale) in multivariable analyses.
AB  - MAIN RESULTS: In this hypertensive majority African American (63%) population, many participants had uncontrolled blood pressure (44%) or diabetes (42%). Few (20%) felt "very likely" to develop CKD and one third (33%) were "very concerned" about developing CKD. Participants who were female and had low health literacy had lower perceived susceptibility to CKD compared to males and those with higher health literacy. Race and diabetes were also associated with perceived susceptibility. Greater perceived susceptibility was associated with poorer blood pressure management adherence scores.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Many high-risk patients have low perceived susceptibility to CKD. Poor blood pressure therapy adherence scores among those with greatest perceived susceptibility suggest fatalistic attitudes about CKD. If our findings are confirmed in larger studies, interventions targeting patient perceptions of CKD risk and other attitudes associated with these perceptions could impact adherence to therapies and health outcomes.

TI  - Influence of patient race on physician prescribing decisions: a randomized on-line experiment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior research reports black patients have lower medication use for hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and diabetes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether patient race influences physicians' prescribing.
AB  - DESIGN: Web-based survey including three clinical vignettes (hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes), with patient race (black, white) randomized across vignettes.
AB  - SUBJECTS: A total of 716 respondents from 5,141 eligible sampled primary care physicians (14% response rate).
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: None
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: Medication recommendation (any medication vs none, on-patent branded vs generic, and therapeutic class) and physicians' treatment adherence forecast (10-point Likert scale, 1-definitely not adhere, 10-definitely adhere).
AB  - RESULTS: Respondents randomized to view black patients (n = 371) and white patients (n = 345) recommend any medications at comparable rates for hypercholesterolemia (100.0% white vs 99.5% black, P = 0.50), hypertension (99.7% white vs 99.5% black, P = 1.00), and diabetes (99.7% white vs 99.7% black, P = 1.00). Patient race influenced medication class chosen in the hypertension vignette; respondents randomized to view black patients recommended calcium channel blockers more often (20.8% black vs 3.2% white) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors less often (47.4% black vs 62.6% white) (P < 0.001). Patient race did not influence medication class for hypercholesterolemia or diabetes. Respondents randomized to view black patients reported lower forecasted patient adherence for hypertension (P < 0.001, mean: 7.3 black vs 7.7 white) and diabetes (P = 0.05 mean: 7.4 black vs 7.6 white), but race had no meaningful influence on forecasted adherence for hypercholesterolemia (P = 0.15, mean: 7.2 black vs 7.3 white).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Racial differences in outpatient prescribing patterns for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes are likely attributable to factors other than prescribing decisions based on patient race.

TI  - The effect of patient race and blood pressure control on patient-physician communication.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Racial disparities in hypertension control contribute to higher rates of cardiovascular mortality among blacks. Patient-physician communication quality is associated with better health outcomes, including blood pressure (BP) control. Both race/ethnicity and BP control may adversely affect communication.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether being black and having poor BP control interact to adversely affect patient-physician communication more than either condition alone, a situation referred to as "double jeopardy."
AB  - DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PATIENTS: Cross-sectional study of enrollment data from a randomized controlled trial of interventions to enhance patient adherence to therapy for hypertension. Participants included 226 hypertensive patients and 39 physicians from 15 primary care practices in Baltimore, MD.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: Communication behaviors and visit length from coding of audiotapes.
AB  - RESULTS: After controlling for patient and physician characteristics, blacks with uncontrolled BP have shorter visits (B = -3.9 min, p < 0.01) with less biomedical (B = -24.0, p = 0.05), psychosocial (B = -19.4, p < 0.01), and rapport-building (B = -19.5, p = 0.01) statements than whites with controlled BP. Of all communication outcomes, blacks with uncontrolled BP are only in "double jeopardy" for a patient positive affect-coders give them lower ratings than all other patients. Blacks with controlled BP also experience shorter visits and less communication with physicians than whites with controlled BP. There are no significant communication differences between the visits of whites with uncontrolled versus controlled BP.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that patient race is associated with the quality of patient-physician communication to a greater extent than BP control. Interventions that improve patient-physician communication should be tested as a strategy to reduce racial disparities in hypertension care and outcomes.

TI  - Implementing a palm pilot intervention for primary care providers: lessons learned.
AB  - The Personal Digital Assistance for Guideline Adherence (GLAD Heart) study was designed to test a strategy to improve quality of care through increased adherence to ATPIII cholesterol guidelines. This paper describes the overall study design including the multi-faceted intervention and outcome measures. Sixty-one primary care practices in NC were recruited and randomized to either a personal digital assistant-based cholesterol management intervention or an intervention similar in intensity and frequency of contact but focused on a hypertension clinical practice guideline. Installation and implementation of the technology intervention was challenging. Over the course of the study, there were 74 technical issues requiring assistance for the palm pilot from 23 participating practices. The GLAD Heart project was completed successfully with some impact on cholesterol management. Technology has the potential to improve the quality of care provided in the healthcare setting. However, potentially expensive interventions such as that conducted in GLAD Heart should undergo rigorous testing to assure their efficacy before widespread adoption.

TI  - Rationale and design of the Study Assessing the Effect of Cardiovascular Medications Provided as Low-cost, Evidence-based Generic Samples (SAMPLES) trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Highly effective generic cardiovascular medications are frequently underused, leading to greater overall drug costs and cost-related nonadherence.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess an intervention to stimulate appropriate generic cardiovascular drug use without creating administrative or financial barriers that may impede essential medication use.
AB  - TRIAL DESIGN: The SAMPLES (Study Assessing the Effect of Cardiovascular Medications Provided as Low-cost, Evidence-based Generic Samples) trial is a clustered, randomized controlled trial of the effect of providing physicians with free generic samples of hydrochlorothiazide for hypertensive patients and simvastatin for patients with hyperlipidemia. We will randomize 660 primary care physicians in Pennsylvania, clustered by physician practice, to receive free samples for both conditions or to receive no samples. We will use data on filled prescriptions obtained from a state-sponsored prescription drug assistance program to perform an intention-to-treat evaluation of the impact of the intervention on physician prescribing behavior (proportion of prescriptions that are generic) and patient adherence. Secondary outcomes will include physician adherence to established guidelines and overall prescription drug costs.
AB  - CONCLUSION: This trial will define the potential role of an innovative approach to stimulate clinically appropriate cost-effective prescribing. We will determine whether free generic samples can reduce overall drug costs as well as out-of-pocket costs to the patient without sacrificing efficacy and whether this approach results in improved adherence to essential cardiovascular medications. This intervention may also improve adherence to practice guidelines and improve the quality of care received. If effective, this strategy could be used broadly by private insurers or government payers aiming to stimulate more cost-effective and higher-quality care.

TI  - Control of blood pressure in North Carolina primary care: baseline data from the GLAD Heart Trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In general, adherence to blood pressure guidelines is low. We assessed whether hypertension recognition and control in North Carolina was consistent with the seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) in primary care practices participating in a quality improvement study regarding the implementation of the ATP3 cholesterol management guideline in primary care in North Carolina (GLAD Heart).
AB  - METHODS: Demographic and clinical data were abstracted from 5,073 charts (patients aged 21-84 years, seen from June 1, 2001 to May 31, 2003) at 60 practices. Sites were non-university based primary care practices from 22 North Carolina counties. A dyslipidemia screening was defined as a lipid profile performed when not on lipid-lowering therapy. Among patients receiving a lipid profile, the proportion with diagnosed, undiagnosed, and controlled hypertension, was calculated according to JNC 7 guidelines. Practice level hypertension control was examined using the median and interquartile range across practices.
AB  - RESULTS: Among 1,763 patients screened for dyslipidemia, 49.4% had diagnosed hypertension. Only 67 individuals (3.8%) had undiagnosed hypertension. Although 85.8% of hypertensive patients were treated, the median proportions of patients with blood pressure below goal (< 140/90, < 130/80 with diabetes) was 33.3% (21.8%-43.7%), with women more likely to be controlled and individuals treated by a solo provider less likely to be controlled.
AB  - LIMITATIONS: These data were abstracted from the charts of patients who received a lipid profile; therefore, they are only generalizable to individuals who are screened for hyperlipidemia.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: There remains a need to improve hypertension management in North Carolina primary care among patients screened for hyperlipidemia.

TI  - Hypertension Improvement Project (HIP): study protocol and implementation challenges.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension affects 29% of the adult U.S. population and is a leading cause of heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Despite numerous effective treatments, only 53% of people with hypertension are at goal blood pressure. The chronic care model suggests that blood pressure control can be achieved by improving how patients and physicians address patient self-care.
AB  - METHODS AND DESIGN: This paper describes the protocol of a nested 2 x 2 randomized controlled trial to test the separate and combined effects on systolic blood pressure of a behavioral intervention for patients and a quality improvement-type intervention for physicians. Primary care practices were randomly assigned to the physician intervention or to the physician control condition. Physician randomization occurred at the clinic level. The physician intervention included training and performance monitoring. The training comprised 2 internet-based modules detailing both the JNC-7 hypertension guidelines and lifestyle modifications for hypertension. Performance data were collected for 18 months, and feedback was provided to physicians every 3 months. Patient participants in both intervention and control clinics were individually randomized to the patient intervention or to usual care. The patient intervention consisted of a 6-month behavioral intervention conducted by trained interventionists in 20 group sessions, followed by 12 monthly phone contacts by community health advisors. Follow-up measurements were performed at 6 and 18 months. The primary outcome was the mean change in systolic blood pressure at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were diastolic blood pressure and the proportion of patients with adequate blood pressure control at 6 and 18 months.
AB  - DISCUSSION: Overall, 8 practices (4 per treatment group), 32 physicians (4 per practice; 16 per treatment group), and 574 patients (289 control and 285 intervention) were enrolled. Baseline characteristics of patients and providers and the challenges faced during study implementation are presented. The HIP interventions may improve blood pressure control and lower cardiovascular disease risk in a primary care practice setting by addressing key components of the chronic care model. The study design allows an assessment of the effectiveness and cost of physician and patient interventions separately, so that health care organizations can make informed decisions about implementation of 1 or both interventions in the context of local resources.

TI  - A multifaceted intervention to improve blood pressure control: The Guideline Adherence for Heart Health (GLAD) study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although high blood pressure is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, the proportion reaching the goal blood pressures as outlined in the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) is low. We conducted a randomized trial in primary care practices of a multifactorial intervention targeted to improve providers' adherence to hypertension guidelines.
AB  - METHOD: A total of 61 primary care practices in North Carolina were randomized to receive either a multifactorial intervention (guideline dissemination via a continuing medical education session, academic detailing sessions, audit and feedback on preintervention rates of adherence, and automated blood pressure machines) or an attention control of similar magnitude but targeted at a different guideline. Outcomes were determined through review of patient charts conducted by an independent masked quality assurance organization.
AB  - RESULTS: We found no difference between the 2 groups in any of the adherence measures including no difference in the percentage of patients at goal (intervention 49.2%, control 50.6%), with undiagnosed hypertension (18.1% vs 13.6%), average systolic (126 vs 125.1 mm Hg), or diastolic blood pressure (73.1 vs 73.4 mm Hg). Similarly, there was no difference in provider adherence to treatment recommendations (use of thiazide-type diuretic as first-line therapy: 32% vs 29.5%; use of 2-drug therapy in stage 2 hypertension: 11.3% vs 10.4%).
AB  - CONCLUSION: An intensive, multifactorial intervention did not improve adherence to national hypertension guidelines among community-based primary care. Efforts should be focused on other types of interventions to improve rates of control of hypertension.

TI  - Can individuals meet multiple physical activity and dietary behavior goals?.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine whether participants with the most behavioral goals to achieve were more likely to meet more goals than those given fewer goals.
AB  - METHODS: Eight hundred ten participants were randomly assigned to advice-only, established guidelines for blood pressure control (reduced sodium, increased physical activity), or established guidelines plus the DASH diet (increased fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy, reduced fat).
AB  - RESULTS: At 6 months, 11.7% of Advice-Only, 19.3% of Established, and 44.6% of Established plus DASH met at least 3 goals (P<0.0001). At 18 months, 33.5% of Established plus DASH met at least 3 goals.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Those with the most goals to achieve reached the most goals.

TI  - A practice-based trial of motivational interviewing and adherence in hypertensive African Americans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor medication adherence is a significant problem in hypertensive African Americans. Although motivational interviewing (MINT) is effective for adoption and maintenance of health behaviors in patients with chronic diseases, its effect on medication adherence remains untested in this population.
AB  - METHODS: This randomized controlled trial tested the effect of a practice-based MINT counseling vs. usual care (UC) on medication adherence and blood pressure (BP) in 190 hypertensive African Americans (88% women; mean age 54 years). Patients were recruited from two community-based primary care practices in New York City. The primary outcome was adherence measured by electronic pill monitors; the secondary outcome was within-patient change in office BP from baseline to 12 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Baseline adherence was similar in both groups (56.2 and 56.6% for MINT and UC, respectively, P = 0.94). Based on intent-to-treat analysis using mixed-effects regression, a significant time x group interaction with model-predicted posttreatment adherence rates of 43 and 57% were found in the UC and MINT groups, respectively (P = 0.027), with a between-group difference of 14% (95% confidence interval, -0.2 to -27%). The between-group difference in systolic and diastolic BP was -6.1 mm Hg (P = 0.065) and -1.4 mm Hg (P = 0.465), respectively, in favor of the MINT group.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A practice-based MINT counseling led to steady maintenance of medication adherence over time, compared to significant decline in adherence for UC patients. This effect was associated with a modest, nonsignificant trend toward a net reduction in systolic BP in favor of the MINT group.

TI  - Integration of depression and hypertension treatment: a pilot, randomized controlled trial.
AB  - PURPOSE: We wanted to examine whether integrating depression treatment into care for hypertension improved adherence to antidepressant and antihypertensive medications, depression outcomes, and blood pressure control among older primary care patients.
AB  - METHODS: Older adults prescribed pharmacotherapy for depression and hypertension from physicians at a large primary care practice in West Philadelphia were randomly assigned to an integrated care intervention or usual care. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 weeks using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) to assess depression, an electronic monitor to measure blood pressure, and the Medication Event Monitoring System to assess adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: In all, 64 participants aged 50 to 80 years participated. Participants in the integrated care intervention had fewer depressive symptoms (CES-D mean scores, intervention 9.9 vs usual care 19.3; P <.01), lower systolic blood pressure (intervention 127.3 mm Hg vs usual care 141.3 mm Hg; P <.01), and lower diastolic blood pressure (intervention 75.8 mm Hg vs usual care 85.0 mm Hg; P <.01) compared with participants in the usual care group at 6 weeks. Compared with the usual care group, the proportion of participants in the intervention group who had 80% or greater adherence to an antidepressant medication (intervention 71.9% vs usual care 31.3%; P <.01) and to an antihypertensive medication (intervention 78.1% vs usual care 31.3%; P <.001) was greater at 6 weeks.
AB  - CONCLUSION: A pilot, randomized controlled trial integrating depression and hypertension treatment was successful in improving patient outcomes. Integrated interventions may be more feasible and effective in real-world practices, where there are competing demands for limited resources.

TI  - Predictive validity of a medication adherence measure in an outpatient setting.
AB  - This study examines the psychometric properties and tests the concurrent and predictive validity of a structured, self-reported medication adherence measure in patients with hypertension. The authors also assessed various psychosocial determinants of adherence, such as knowledge, social support, satisfaction with care, and complexity of the medical regimen. A total of 1367 patients participated in the study; mean age was 52.5 years, 40.8% were male, 76.5% were black, 50.8% graduated from high school, 26% were married, and 54.1% had income <$5,000. The 8-item medication adherence scale was reliable (alpha=.83) and significantly associated with blood pressure control (P<.05). Using a cutpoint of <6, the sensitivity of the measure to identify patients with poor blood pressure control was estimated to be 93%, and the specificity was 53%. The medication adherence measure proved to be reliable, with good concurrent and predictive validity in primarily low-income, minority patients with hypertension and might function as a screening tool in outpatient settings with other patient groups.

TI  - A cluster randomized trial to evaluate physician/pharmacist collaboration to improve blood pressure control.
AB  - This was a prospective, cluster randomized controlled trial in patients with uncontrolled hypertension aged 21 to 85 years (mean, 61 years). Pharmacists made recommendations to physicians for patients in the intervention clinics (n=101) but not patients in the control clinics (n=78). The mean adjusted difference in systolic blood pressure (BP) between the control and intervention groups was 8.7 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.4-12.9), while the difference in diastolic BP was 5.4 mm Hg (CI, 2.8-8.0) at 9 months. The 24-hour BP levels showed similar effects, with a mean systolic BP level that was 8.8 mm Hg lower (CI, 5.0-12.6) and a mean diastolic BP level that was 4.6 mm Hg (CI, 2.4-6.8) lower in the intervention group. BP was controlled in 89.1% of patients in the intervention group and 52.9% in the control group (adjusted odds ratio, 8.9; CI, 3.8-20.7; P<.001). Physician/pharmacist collaboration achieved significantly better mean BP values and overall BP control rates, primarily by intensification of medication therapy and improving patient adherence.

TI  - Take Control of Your Blood Pressure (TCYB) study: a multifactorial tailored behavioral and educational intervention for achieving blood pressure control.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluating a randomized controlled trial involving a tailored behavioral intervention conducted to improve blood pressure control.
AB  - METHODS: Adults with hypertension from two outpatient primary care clinics were randomly allocated to receive a nurse-administered behavioral intervention or usual care. In this ongoing study, patients receive the tailored behavioral intervention bi-monthly for 2 years via telephone; the goal of the intervention is to promote medication adherence and improve hypertension-related health behaviors. Patient factors targeted in the tailored behavioral intervention include perceived risk of hypertension and knowledge, memory, medical and social support, patients' relationship with their health care provider, adverse effects of medication therapy, weight management, exercise, diet, stress, smoking, and alcohol use.
AB  - RESULTS: The sample randomized to the behavioral intervention consisted of 319 adults with hypertension (average age=60.5 years; 47% African-American). A comparable sample of adults was assigned to usual care (n=317). We had a 96% retention rate for the overall sample for the first 6 months of the study (93% at 12 months). The average phone call has lasted 18min (range 2-51min). From baseline to 6 months, self-reported medication adherence increased by 9% in the behavioral group vs. 1% in the non-behavioral group.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The intervention is easily implemented and is designed to enhance adherence with prescribed hypertension regimen. The study includes both general and patient-tailored information based upon need assessment. The study design ensures internal validity as well as the ability to generalize study findings to the clinic settings.
AB  - PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Despite knowledge of the risks and acceptable evidence, a large number of hypertensive adults still do not have their blood pressure under effective control. This study will be an important step in evaluating a tailored multibehavioral intervention focusing on improving blood pressure control.

TI  - Effect of general practitioner education on adherence to antihypertensive drugs: cluster randomised controlled trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of a simple educational package for general practitioners on adherence to antihypertensive drugs.
AB  - DESIGN: Cluster randomised controlled trial.
AB  - SETTING: Six randomly selected communities in Karachi, Pakistan.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: 200 patients with hypertension taking antihypertensive drugs; 78 general practitioners.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Care by general practitioners specially trained in management of hypertension compared with usual care.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Correct dosing, defined as percentage of prescribed doses taken, measured with electronic medication event monitoring system (MEMS) bottle.
AB  - RESULTS: 200 patients were enrolled, and 178 (89%) successfully completed six weeks of follow-up. Adherence was significantly greater in the special care group than in the usual care group (unadjusted mean percentage days with correct dose 48.1%, 95% confidence interval 35.8% to 60.4%, versus 32.4%, 22.6% to 42.3%; P=0.048). Adherence was also higher among patients who had higher levels of education (P<0.001), were encouraged by family members (P<0.001), believed in the effect of drugs (P<0.001), and had the purpose of the drugs explained to them (P<0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Special training of general practitioners in management of hypertension, emphasising good communication between doctors and patients, is more effective than usual care provided in the communities in Karachi. Such simple interventions should be adopted by other developing countries that are now facing an increasing burden of hypertension.

TI  - Electronic communications and home blood pressure monitoring (e-BP) study: design, delivery, and evaluation framework.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials have provided unequivocal evidence that treatment of hypertension decreases mortality and major disability from cardiovascular disease; however, blood pressure remains inadequately treated in most affected individuals. This large gap continues despite the facts that more than 90% of adults with hypertension have health insurance, and hypertension is the leading cause of visits to the doctor. New approaches are needed to improve hypertension care.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Electronic Communications and Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (e-BP) study is a three-arm randomized controlled trial designed to determine whether care based on the Chronic Care Model and delivered over the Internet improves hypertension care. The primary study outcomes are systolic, diastolic, and blood pressure control; secondary outcomes are medication adherence, patient self-efficacy, satisfaction and quality of life, and healthcare utilization and costs.
AB  - METHODS: Hypertensive patients receiving care at Group Health medical centers are eligible if they have uncontrolled blood pressure on two screening visits and access to the Web and an e-mail address. Study participants are randomly assigned to three intervention groups: (a) usual care; (b) home blood pressure monitoring receipt and proficiency training on its use and the Group Health secure patient website (with secure e-mail access to their healthcare provider, access to a shared medical record, prescription refill and other services); or (c) this plus pharmacist care management (collaborative care management between the patient, the pharmacist, and the patient's physician via a secure patient website and the electronic medical record).
AB  - CONCLUSION: We will determine whether a new model of patient-centered care that leverages Web communications, self-monitoring, and collaborative care management improves hypertension control. If this model proves successful and cost-effective, similar interventions could be used to improve the care of large numbers of patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

TI  - Identifying barriers to hypertension guideline adherence using clinician feedback at the point of care.
AB  - Factors contributing to low adherence to clinical guidelines by clinicians are not well understood. The user interface of ATHENA-HTN, a guideline-based decision support system (DSS) for hypertension, presents a novel opportunity to collect clinician feedback on recommendations displayed at the point of care. We analyzed feedback from 46 clinicians who received ATHENA advisories as part of a 15-month randomized trial to identify potential reasons clinicians may not intensify hypertension therapy when it is recommended. Among the 368 visits for which feedback was provided, clinicians commonly reported they did not follow recommendations because: recorded blood pressure was not representative of the patient's typical blood pressure; hypertension was not a clinical priority for the visit; or patients were nonadherent to medications. For many visits, current quality-assurance algorithms may incorrectly identify clinically appropriate decisions as guideline nonadherent due to incomplete capture of relevant information. We present recommendations for how automated DSSs may help identify "apparent" barriers and better target decision support.

TI  - Efficacy of a transtheoretical model-based expert system for antihypertensive adherence.
AB  - Blood pressure is not controlled in as many as 50%-75% of hypertensive patients, primarily because of inadequate adherence to treatment. This paper examines the efficacy of a Transtheoretical Model (TTM)-based expert system intervention designed to improve adherence with antihypertensives in a sample of 1,227 adults. Participants were proactively recruited and randomly assigned to receive usual care or three individualized expert system reports and a stage-matched manual over 6 months. Participants were surveyed at baseline, and 6, 12, and 18 months. Significantly more of the intervention group participants reported being in Action and Maintenance at follow-up time points (ie, 73.1% of the treatment group versus 57.6% of the control group at 12 months and 69.1% of the treatment group versus 59.2% of the control group at 18 months). Scores on a behavioral measure of nonadherence differed significantly at follow-up time points. TTM-based expert system interventions have the potential for a significant impact on entire populations of individuals who fail to adhere, regardless of their readiness to change.

TI  - [Prevention of therapeutic inertia in the treatment of arterial hypertension by using a program of home blood pressure monitoring]. [Spanish]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a program of home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) on therapeutic Inertia (TI) in mild-to-moderate hypertension (AHT).
AB  - DESIGN: Controlled, randomised clinical trial.
AB  - SETTING: Forty six clinics in 35 primary care centres. Spain.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: A total of 232 patients with uncontrolled hypertension were included.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Two groups with 116 patients were formed: 1) Control group (CG): standard health intervention; 2) Intervention group (IG): patients who were included in the HBPM program.
AB  - MAIN MEASUREMENTS: TI was calculated by the ratio: Number of patients whose pharmacological treatment was not changed in each visit/Number of patients with an average BP 140mmHg and/or 90mmHg in the general population or 130 and/or 90 mmHg in diabetics. The mean BPs and the percentage of controlled patients were calculated. The mean number of people that required an intervention in order to avoid TI was calculated (NI).
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 209 patients completed the study, with TI in 35.64% (95% CI=29.85%-41.43%) of the sample, and in 71.63% (95% CI=63.9-79.36%) of the uncontrolled hypertensive patients. The TI was 22.42% (95% CI=24.2-37%) in the IG and 50% (95% CI=37.75-62.25) in the CG (p<.05) in visit 2, and 25.23% (95% CI=14.84-35.62) and 46.07% (95% CI=33.85-58.29) in the final visit for IG and CG, respectively (P<.05). The NI was 4.3.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: TI was very significant among the uncontrolled hypertensive patients. The studied interventions are effective for improving TI.Copyright A© 2010 Elsevier Espana, S.L. All rights reserved.

TI  - [Non-pharmacological intervention as a strategy to improve antihypertensive treatment compliance]. [Spanish]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of an intervention by means of an educational magazine on treatment compliance in uncontrolled arterial hypertension (AHT).
AB  - DESIGN: Controlled, randomised clinical trial.
AB  - SETTING: 87 primary care centres. Spain.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: A total of 450 patients with uncontrolled hypertension were included.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Two groups of 225 patients were formed: 1) Control group (CG): standard health intervention; 2) Intervention Group (IG): received a twice monthly educational magazine at home.
AB  - MAIN MEASUREMENTS: Compliance was measured using the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS-Aardex). Compliance rate (CR) was recorded. Compliers were defined as individuals with a treatment compliance of 80-110%. The percentage of compliers, the mean percentage of doses taken and the percentage of patients taking the medication at the correct times were estimated. The mean blood pressures (BPs) and the percentage of controlled patientswere calculated. The number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 393 individuals were evaluable (Age: 62.4 years), 196 in the IG and 197 in the CG. There were 83.2% (95% CI 78-88.4) and 49.2% (95% CI 42.2-56.2) (P=0.0001) of overall compliers in the IG and CG, respectively and 74% (95% CI: 67.9-80.1) and 42.6% (95% CI=35.7-49.5) (P=0.0001) of correct times compliers. A total of 81.6% (95% CI=76.2-86.5%)) were controlled in the IG and 56.3% (95% CI=49.4-63.2) in the CG. The NNT was 3.3 patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic non-compliance was very high. The educational magazine is an effective strategy to improve the compliance and degree of control of the AHT.

TI  - Effect of a pharmacy care program on medication adherence and persistence, blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - CONTEXT: Poor medication adherence diminishes the health benefits of pharmacotherapies. Elderly patients with coronary risk factors frequently require treatment with multiple medications, placing them at increased risk for nonadherence.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of a comprehensive pharmacy care program to improve medication adherence and its associated effects on blood pressure (BP) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).
AB  - DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A multiphase, prospective study with an observational phase and a randomized controlled trial conducted at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center of 200 community-based patients aged 65 years or older taking at least 4 chronic medications. The study was conducted from June 2004 to August 2006.
AB  - INTERVENTION: After a 2-month run-in phase (measurement of baseline adherence, BP, and LDL-C), patients entered a 6-month intervention phase (standardized medication education, regular follow-up by pharmacists, and medications dispensed in time-specific packs). Following the intervention phase, patients were randomized to continued pharmacy care vs usual care for an additional 6 months.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary end point of the observation phase was change in the proportion of pills taken vs baseline; secondary end points were the associated changes in BP and LDL-C. Primary end point of the randomization phase was the between-group comparison of medication persistence.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 200 elderly patients (77.1% men; mean [SD] age, 78 [8.3] years), taking a mean (SD) of 9 (3) chronic medications were enrolled. Coronary risk factors included drug-treated hypertension in 184 patients (91.5%) and drug-treated hyperlipidemia in 162 (80.6%). Mean (SD) baseline medication adherence was 61.2% (13.5%). After 6 months of intervention, medication adherence increased to 96.9% (5.2%; P<.001) and was associated with significant improvements in systolic BP (133.2 [14.9] to 129.9 [16.0] mm Hg; P = .02) and LDL-C (91.7 [26.1] to 86.8 [23.4] mg/dL; P = .001). Six months after randomization, the persistence of medication adherence decreased to 69.1% (16.4%) among those patients assigned to usual care, whereas it was sustained at 95.5% (7.7%) in pharmacy care (P<.001). This was associated with significant reductions in systolic BP in the pharmacy care group (-6.9 mm Hg; 95% CI, -10.7 to -3.1 mm Hg) vs the usual care group (-1.0 mm Hg; 95% CI, -5.9 to 3.9 mm Hg; P = .04), but no significant between-group differences in LDL-C levels or reductions.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A pharmacy care program led to increases in medication adherence, medication persistence, and clinically meaningful reductions in BP, whereas discontinuation of the program was associated with decreased medication adherence and persistence.

TI  - Comparison of the Atkins, Ornish, Weight Watchers, and Zone diets for weight loss and heart disease risk reduction: a randomized trial.
AB  - CONTEXT: The scarcity of data addressing the health effects of popular diets is an important public health concern, especially since patients and physicians are interested in using popular diets as individualized eating strategies for disease prevention.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess adherence rates and the effectiveness of 4 popular diets (Atkins, Zone, Weight Watchers, and Ornish) for weight loss and cardiac risk factor reduction.
AB  - DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A single-center randomized trial at an academic medical center in Boston, Mass, of overweight or obese (body mass index: mean, 35; range, 27-42) adults aged 22 to 72 years with known hypertension, dyslipidemia, or fasting hyperglycemia. Participants were enrolled starting July 18, 2000, and randomized to 4 popular diet groups until January 24, 2002.
AB  - INTERVENTION: A total of 160 participants were randomly assigned to either Atkins (carbohydrate restriction, n=40), Zone (macronutrient balance, n=40), Weight Watchers (calorie restriction, n=40), or Ornish (fat restriction, n=40) diet groups. After 2 months of maximum effort, participants selected their own levels of dietary adherence.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: One-year changes in baseline weight and cardiac risk factors, and self-selected dietary adherence rates per self-report.
AB  - RESULTS: Assuming no change from baseline for participants who discontinued the study, mean (SD) weight loss at 1 year was 2.1 (4.8) kg for Atkins (21 [53%] of 40 participants completed, P = .009), 3.2 (6.0) kg for Zone (26 [65%] of 40 completed, P = .002), 3.0 (4.9) kg for Weight Watchers (26 [65%] of 40 completed, P < .001), and 3.3 (7.3) kg for Ornish (20 [50%] of 40 completed, P = .007). Greater effects were observed in study completers. Each diet significantly reduced the low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio by approximately 10% (all P<.05), with no significant effects on blood pressure or glucose at 1 year. Amount of weight loss was associated with self-reported dietary adherence level (r = 0.60; P<.001) but not with diet type (r = 0.07; P = .40). For each diet, decreasing levels of total/HDL cholesterol, C-reactive protein, and insulin were significantly associated with weight loss (mean r = 0.36, 0.37, and 0.39, respectively) with no significant difference between diets (P = .48, P = .57, P = .31, respectively).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Each popular diet modestly reduced body weight and several cardiac risk factors at 1 year. Overall dietary adherence rates were low, although increased adherence was associated with greater weight loss and cardiac risk factor reductions for each diet group.

TI  - Effect of estrogen plus progestin on stroke in postmenopausal women: the Women's Health Initiative: a randomized trial.
AB  - CONTEXT: The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial of estrogen plus progestin was stopped early because of adverse effects, including an increased risk of stroke in the estrogen plus progestin group.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of estrogen plus progestin on ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke and in subgroups, and to determine whether the effect of estrogen plus progestin was modified by baseline levels of blood biomarkers.
AB  - DESIGN: Multicenter double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial involving 16 608 women aged 50 through 79 years with an average follow-up of 5.6 years. Baseline levels of blood-based markers of inflammation, thrombosis, and lipid levels were measured in the first 140 centrally confirmed stroke cases and 513 controls.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Participants received 0.625 mg/d of conjugated equine estrogen plus 2.5 mg/d of medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 8506) or placebo (n = 8102).
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall strokes and stroke subtype and severity were centrally adjudicated by stroke neurologists.
AB  - RESULTS: One hundred fifty-one patients (1.8%) in the estrogen plus progestin and 107 (1.3%) in the placebo groups had strokes. Overall 79.8% of strokes were ischemic. For combined ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, the intention-to-treat hazard ratio (HR) for estrogen plus progestin vs placebo was 1.31 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.68); with adjustment for adherence, the HR was 1.50 (95% CI, 1.08-2.08). The HR for ischemic stroke was 1.44 (95% CI, 1.09-1.90) and for hemorrhagic stroke, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.43-1.56). Point estimates of the HRs indicate that excess risk of all stroke was apparent in all age groups, in all categories of baseline stroke risk, and in women with and without hypertension, prior history of cardiovascular disease, use of hormones, statins, or aspirin. Other risk factors for stroke, including smoking, blood pressure, diabetes, lower use of vitamin C supplements, blood-based biomarkers of inflammation, higher white blood cell count, and higher hematocrit levels did not modify the effect of estrogen plus progestin on stroke risk.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Estrogen plus progestin increases the risk of ischemic stroke in generally healthy postmenopausal women. Excess risk for all strokes attributed to estrogen plus progestin appeared to be present in all subgroups of women examined.

TI  - Pilot Study to Test the Effectiveness of Different Financial Incentives to Improve Medication Adherence.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication nonadherence affects health care costs, morbidity, and mortality. Concepts from behavioral economics can guide the development of interventions to improve medication adherence.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure the relative effectiveness of 2 behavioral economic-based incentive structures to improve medication adherence.
AB  - METHODS: This randomized controlled trial compared adherence among participants taking antihypertensive or antihyperlipidemic medications randomized to usual care (UC), guaranteed pay-out (GPO) incentives, or lottery incentives. Daily adherence was measured over a 90-day period using electronic caps (Medication Event Monitoring System [MEMS]). The GPO group received $30 up-front in a virtual account, with $0.50 deducted for each missed dose. Lottery group participants were eligible for a weekly $50 drawing, but only if they had taken their medication as prescribed all week. An electronic survey assessed self-reported adherence. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, paired t tests, ANOVA, and Pearson's correlations.
AB  - RESULTS: In all, 36 participants were randomized (UC, n = 11; GPO, n = 14; lottery, n = 11). Mean percentage (+/-SD) of days adherent during the incentive period was highest in the lottery group (96% +/- 5%), followed by the GPO group (94% +/- 9%) and the UC group (94% +/- 9%). There were no statistically significant differences among groups (P > 0.05). MEMS-measured adherence was not significantly correlated with a patient's self-reported adherence (P > 0.05) at baseline but was correlated at 90-day follow-up (P < 0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Although no statistically significant differences in adherence were demonstrated in this small sample of highly adherent participants, larger studies in a more diverse population or with other medications might show otherwise.Copyright © The Author(s) 2015.

TI  - Stop Hypertension with the Acupuncture Research Program (SHARP): results of a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  - Case studies and small trials suggest that acupuncture may effectively treat hypertension, but no large randomized trials have been reported. The Stop Hypertension with the Acupuncture Research Program pilot trial enrolled 192 participants with untreated blood pressure (BP) in the range of 140/90 to 179/109 mm Hg. The design of the trial combined rigorous methodology and adherence to principles of traditional Chinese medicine. Participants were weaned off antihypertensives before enrollment and were then randomly assigned to 3 treatments: individualized traditional Chinese acupuncture, standardized acupuncture at preselected points, or invasive sham acupuncture. Participants received < or = 12 acupuncture treatments over 6 to 8 weeks. During the first 10 weeks after random assignment, BP was monitored every 14 days, and antihypertensives were prescribed if BP exceeded 180/110 mm Hg. The mean BP decrease from baseline to 10 weeks, the primary end point, did not differ significantly between participants randomly assigned to active (individualized and standardized) versus sham acupuncture (systolic BP: -3.56 versus -3.84 mm Hg, respectively; 95% CI for the difference: -4.0 to 4.6 mm Hg; P=0.90; diastolic BP: -4.32 versus -2.81 mm Hg, 95% CI for the difference: -3.6 to 0.6 mm Hg; P=0.16). Categorizing participants by age, race, gender, baseline BP, history of antihypertensive use, obesity, or primary traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis did not reveal any subgroups for which the benefits of active acupuncture differed significantly from sham acupuncture. Active acupuncture provided no greater benefit than invasive sham acupuncture in reducing systolic or diastolic BP.

TI  - Medication Adherence and the Risk of Cardiovascular Mortality and Hospitalization Among Patients With Newly Prescribed Antihypertensive Medications.
AB  - The importance of adherence to antihypertensive treatments for the prevention of cardiovascular disease has not been well elucidated. This study evaluated the effect of antihypertensive medication adherence on specific cardiovascular disease mortality (ischemic heart disease [IHD], cerebral hemorrhage, and cerebral infarction). Our study used data from a 3% sample cohort that was randomly extracted from enrollees of Korean National Health Insurance. Study subjects were aged >20 years, were diagnosed with hypertension, and started newly prescribed antihypertensive medication in 2003 to 2004. Adherence to antihypertensive medication was estimated as the cumulative medication adherence. Subjects were divided into good (cumulative medication adherence, >80%), intermediate (cumulative medication adherence, 50%-80%), and poor (cumulative medication adherence, <50%) adherence groups. We used time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the association between medication adherence and health outcomes. Among 33728 eligible subjects, 670 (1.99%) died of coronary heart disease or stroke during follow-up. Patients with poor medication adherence had worse mortality from IHD (hazard ratio, 1.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-2.31; P for trend=0.005), cerebral hemorrhage (hazard ratio, 2.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-3.77; P for trend=0.004), and cerebral infarction (hazard ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-2.96; P for trend=0.003) than those with good adherence. The estimated hazard ratios of hospitalization for cardiovascular disease were consistent with the mortality end point. Poor medication adherence was associated with higher mortality and a greater risk of hospitalization for specific cardiovascular diseases, emphasizing the importance of a monitoring system and strategies to improve medication adherence in clinical practice.

TI  - Adherence with antihypertensive drug therapy and the risk of heart failure in clinical practice.
AB  - Randomized clinical trials have shown that antihypertensive treatment reduces the risk of heart failure (HF). Limited evidence exists, however, on whether and to what extent this benefit is translated into real-life practice. A nested case-control study was carried out by including the cohort of 76 017 patients from Lombardy (Italy), aged 40 to 80 years, who were newly treated with antihypertensive drugs during 2005. Cases were the 622 patients who experienced hospitalization for HF from initial prescription until 2012. Up to 5 controls were randomly selected for each case. Logistic regression was used to model the HF risk associated with adherence to antihypertensive drugs, which was measured by the proportion of days covered by treatment (PDC). Data were adjusted for several covariates. Sensitivity analyses were performed to account for possible sources of systematic uncertainty. Compared with patients with very low adherence (PDC, <25%), low, intermediate, and high adherences were associated with progressively lower risk of HF, reduction in the high-adherence group (>75%) being 34% (95% confidence interval, 17%-48%). Similar effects were observed in younger (40-70 years) and older (71-80 years) patients and between patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics. There was no evidence that adherence with calcium-channel blockers reduced the HF risk. Antihypertensive treatment lowers the HF risk in real-life practice, but adherence to treatment is necessary for a substantial benefit to take place. This is the case with a variety of antihypertensive drugs. Copyright © 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.

TI  - Randomized comparison of renal denervation versus intensified pharmacotherapy including spironolactone in true-resistant hypertension: six-month results from the Prague-15 study.
AB  - This prospective, randomized, open-label multicenter trial evaluated the efficacy of catheter-based renal denervation (Symplicity, Medtronic) versus intensified pharmacological treatment including spironolactone (if tolerated) in patients with true-resistant hypertension. This was confirmed by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring after excluding secondary hypertension and confirmation of adherence to therapy by measurement of plasma antihypertensive drug levels before enrollment. One-hundred six patients were randomized to renal denervation (n=52), or intensified pharmacological treatment (n=54) with baseline systolic blood pressure of 159+/-17 and 155+/-17 mm Hg and average number of drugs 5.1 and 5.4, respectively. A significant reduction in 24-hour average systolic blood pressure after 6 months (-8.6 [95% cofidence interval: -11.8, -5.3] mm Hg; P<0.001 in renal denervation versus -8.1 [95% cofidence interval: -12.7, -3.4] mm Hg; P=0.001 in pharmacological group) was observed, which was comparable in both groups. Similarly, a significant reduction in systolic office blood pressure (-12.4 [95% cofidence interval: -17.0, -7.8] mm Hg; P<0.001 in renal denervation versus -14.3 [95% cofidence interval: -19.7, -8.9] mm Hg; P<0.001 in pharmacological group) was present. Between-group differences in change were not significant. The average number of antihypertensive drugs used after 6 months was significantly higher in the pharmacological group (+0.3 drugs; P<0.001). A significant increase in serum creatinine and a parallel decrease of creatinine clearance were observed in the pharmacological group; between-group difference were borderline significant. The 6-month results of this study confirmed the safety of renal denervation. In conclusion, renal denervation achieved reduction of blood pressure comparable with intensified pharmacotherapy.

TI  - Effectiveness of a tailored behavioral intervention to improve hypertension control: primary outcomes of a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - UNLABELLED: Blood pressure (BP) control rates are suboptimal. We evaluated the effectiveness of 2 behavioral interventions to improve BP control via a 3-arm, randomized controlled trial of 533 adults with repeated uncontrolled BP, despite antihypertensive drug treatment for >6 months. The interventions were a tailored stage-matched intervention (SMI) or a nontailored health education intervention (HEI) of 6 monthly calls targeting diet, exercise, and medication. Control was usual care (UC). There were no baseline group differences. Baseline BP control was 42.6%, 40.6%, and 44.6% in SMI, HEI, and UC (P=0.74), respectively; systolic BP (with SEs) was 136 (0.89), 137 (1.33), and 137 (0.96) mm Hg. Six-month control was 64.6% (SMI), 54.3% (HEI), and 45.8% (UC) (P values for pairwise comparisons versus UC, 0.001 [SMI] and 0.108 [HEI]). At 6 months, systolic BP (SE) was 131.2 (1.05), 131.8 (0.99), and 134.7 (1.02) for SMI, HEI, and UC, respectively (P values for pairwise comparisons versus UC, 0.009 for SMI and 0.047 for HEI). SMI led to lower systolic BP and better BP control than UC. SMI constitutes a new, potent approach to assist patients with uncontrolled hypertension to reach BP goals.

TI  - Adjusted drug treatment is superior to renal sympathetic denervation in patients with true treatment-resistant hypertension.
AB  - We aimed to investigate for the first time the blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect of renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) versus clinically adjusted drug treatment in true treatment-resistant hypertension (TRH) after excluding patients with confounding poor drug adherence. Patients with apparent TRH (n=65) were referred for RDN, and those with secondary and spurious hypertension (n=26) were excluded. TRH was defined as office systolic BP (SBP) >140 mm Hg, despite maximally tolerated doses of >3 antihypertensive drugs including a diuretic. In addition, ambulatory daytime SBP >135 mm Hg after witnessed intake of antihypertensive drugs was required, after which 20 patients had normalized BP and were excluded. Patients with true TRH were randomized and underwent RDN (n=9) performed with Symplicity Catheter System versus clinically adjusted drug treatment (n=10). The study was stopped early for ethical reasons because RDN had uncertain BP-lowering effect. Office SBP and diastolic BP in the drug-adjusted group changed from 160+/-14/88+/-13 mm Hg (+/-SD) at baseline to 132+/-10/77+/-8 mm Hg at 6 months (P<0.0005 and P=0.02, SBP and diastolic BP, respectively) and in the RDN group from 156+/-13/91+/-15 to 148+/-7/89+/-8 mm Hg (P=0.42 and P=0.48, SBP and diastolic BP, respectively). SBP and diastolic BP were significantly lower in the drug-adjusted group at 6 months (P=0.002 and P=0.004, respectively), and absolute changes in SBP were larger in the drug-adjusted group (P=0.008). Ambulatory BPs changed in parallel to office BPs. Our data suggest that adjusted drug treatment has superior BP lowering effects compared with RDN in patients with true TRH.

TI  - Monitoring adherence to medication by measuring change in blood pressure.
AB  - After starting antihypertensives, blood pressure is monitored for several reasons, including assessment of adherence. We aimed to estimate the accuracy of blood pressure monitoring for detecting early nonadherence. We conducted a secondary analysis of the Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS), a large randomized trial of blood pressure lowering to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke. We compared change in blood pressure 3 months after randomization in people who had discontinued treatment (nonadherent) with those who stayed on treatment (adherent). We also used an indirect method, assessing whether change in blood pressure discriminated between active (adherent) and placebo (nonadherent) groups. Both methods gave similar results. For the 3433 subjects, the mean (SD) of the change in systolic blood pressure was -15.8 mm Hg (SD 18.7 mm Hg) in the adherent group and -4.2 mm Hg (SD 18.1 mm Hg) in the nonadherent group. After recalibration of the mean change in the nonadherent group to 0 mm Hg and in the adherent group to -11.6 mm Hg, the absence of a fall in systolic blood pressure at 3 months had a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 80% for detecting nonadherence (50% of nonadherent patients and 20% of adherent patients had a rise in blood pressure). Discriminatory power was modest over the range of cutoffs (area under the receiver-operator curve 0.67). Monitoring blood pressure is poor at detecting nonadherence to blood pressure-lowering treatment. Further research should look at other methods of assessing adherence.

TI  - Characteristics of 9194 patients with left ventricular hypertrophy: the LIFE study. Losartan Intervention For Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension.
AB  - -Losartan was the first available orally administered selective antagonist of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor developed for the treatment of hypertension. The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint (LIFE) Reduction in Hypertension Study is a double-blind, prospective, parallel group study designed to compare the effects of losartan with those of the beta-blocker atenolol on the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Patients with essential hypertension, aged between 55 and 80 years, and ECG-documented left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) were included. Altogether, 9223 patients in Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, and the United States were randomized from June 1995 through April 1997, and 9194 remain after exclusion of a study center at which irregularities were discovered. This population of hypertensives (mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure, 174.4/97.8 mm Hg) with LVH comprises women (54.1%) and men, mostly retired from active work (mean age, 66.9 years), with a high prevalence of overweight (mean body mass index, 28.0 kg/m2), diabetes mellitus (12.3%), lipid disorders (18.0%), and symptoms or signs of coronary heart disease (15.1%). There were fewer current smokers (<17%) than in the general population, and approximately 7% were nonwhite. Almost 30% of participants had been untreated for at least 6 months when screened for the study. Only 1557 persons who entered the placebo run-in period of 14 days were excluded, predominantly because of sitting blood pressures above or below the predetermined range of 160-200/95-115 mm Hg and ECG-LVH criteria not met. By application of simple 12-lead ECG criteria for LVH (Cornell voltage QRS duration product formula plus Sokolow-Lyon voltage read by a core laboratory), hypertensive patients with LVH with an average 5-year coronary heart disease risk of 22.3% according to the Framingham score were identified. This population is now being treated (goal, <140/90 mm Hg) in adherence with the protocol for at least 4 years after final enrollment (ie, through April 2001) and until at least 1040 patients suffer myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death.

TI  - An informed shared decision making programme on the prevention of myocardial infarction for patients with type 2 diabetes in primary care: protocol of a cluster randomised, controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: International and national societies claim a patient centred approach including shared decision making (SDM) in diabetes care. In a previous project, a SDM programme on the prevention of myocardial infarction has been developed. It is aimed at supporting patients with type 2 diabetes to make informed choices on preventive options, to share the decision making process with the health care team, and to improve adherence to the chosen treatment. In this study, the programme will be implemented and evaluated in primary care practices.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: A cluster randomised, controlled trial will be conducted to compare the SDM programme with standard care enrolling patients with type 2 diabetes (N = 306) from primary care practices (N = 24). The intervention programme comprises a six hours provider training, a patient decision aid including evidence-based information, a 90 minutes structured teaching session provided by medical assistants, a sheet to document the patients' individual treatment goals, and a structured consultation with the general practitioner for sharing information, setting treatment goals, and for adapting treatment regimens if necessary. Patients in the control group receive a brief extract of recommendations of the German National Disease Management Guideline on the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. Primary outcome measure is adherence to blood pressure treatment and statin treatment at 6 months follow-up. Secondary outcome measures comprise informed choice and the achievement of patients' treatment goals. Analyses will be carried out on intention-to-treat basis. Concurrent qualitative methods will be used to explore the implementation processes.
AB  - DISCUSSION: At the end of this study, information on the efficacy of the SDM programme in the primary care context will be available. In addition, processes that might interfere with or that might promote a successful implementation will be identified.

TI  - Medication Routines and Adherence Among Hypertensive African Americans.
AB  - Poor adherence to prescribed medication regimens remains an important challenge preventing successful treatment of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension. While studies have documented differences in the time of day or weekday vs weekend on medication adherence, no study has examined whether having a medication-taking routine contributes to increased medication adherence. The purpose of this study was to: (1) identify patients' sociodemographic factors associated with consistent medication-taking routine; (2) examine associations between medication-taking consistency, medication adherence, and blood pressure (BP) control. The study included black patients with hypertension (n = 190; 22 men and 168 women; age, mean+/-standard deviation 54 +/- 12.08 years) who completed a practice-based randomized controlled trial. Findings showed that medication-taking consistency was significantly associated with better medication adherence (F = 9.54, P = .002). Associations with the consistency index were not statistically significant for diastolic BP control (odds ratio, 1.319; 95% confidence interval, 0.410-4.246; P = .642) and systolic BP control (odds ratio, 0.621; 95% confidence interval, 0.195-1.974; P = .419).

TI  - A centralized cardiovascular risk service to improve guideline adherence in private primary care offices.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many large health systems now employ clinical pharmacists in team-based care to assist patients and physicians with management of cardiovascular (CV) diseases. However, small private offices often lack the resources to hire a clinical pharmacist for their office. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a centralized, web-based CV risk service (CVRS) managed by clinical pharmacists will improve guideline adherence in primary care medical offices in rural and small communities.
AB  - METHODS: This study is a cluster randomized prospective trial in 12 primary care offices. Medical offices were randomized to either the CVRS intervention or usual care. The intervention will last for 12 months and all subjects will have research visits at baseline and 12 months. Primary outcomes will include adherence to treatment guidelines and control of key CV risk factors. Data will also be abstracted from the medical record at 30 months to determine if the intervention effect is sustained after it is discontinued.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This study will enroll subjects through 2015 and results will be available in 2018. This study will provide information on whether a distant, centralized CV risk service can improve guideline adherence in medical offices that lack the resources to employ clinical pharmacists.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Pharmacist intervention for blood pressure control: medication intensification and adherence.
AB  - The objective of this study was to describe medication adherence and medication intensification in a physician-pharmacist collaborative management (PPCM) model compared with usual care. This study was a prospective, cluster, randomized study in 32 primary care offices from 15 states. The primary outcomes were medication adherence and anti-hypertensive medication changes during the first 9 months of the intervention. The 9-month visit was completed by 539 patients, 345 of which received the intervention. There was no significant difference between intervention and usual care patients in regards to medication adherence at 9 months. Intervention patients received significantly more medication changes (4.9 vs.1.1; P = .0003) and had significantly increased use of diuretics and aldosterone antagonists when compared with usual care (P = .01).The PPCM model increased medication intensification; however, no significant change in medication adherence was detected. PPCM models will need to develop non-adherence identification and intervention methods to further improve the potency of the care team. Copyright © 2015 American Society of Hypertension.

TI  - Effects of intensive low-salt diet education on albuminuria among nondiabetic patients with hypertension treated with olmesartan: a single-blinded randomized, controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The antiproteinuric effect of a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade can be magnified by dietary salt restriction. This study sought to determine the effect of intensive low-salt diet education on BP and urine albumin excretion in nondiabetic patients with hypertension and albuminuria.
AB  - DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This study was conducted between March of 2012 and March of 2013 as an open-label, randomized, controlled trial. After a run-in period of 8 weeks, all patients received the angiotensin II receptor blocker olmesartan (40 mg daily). Patients were then divided into two groups. One group was treated for another 8 weeks with angiotensin II receptor blocker plus conventional low-salt diet education, and the other group was treated for 8 weeks with angiotensin II receptor blocker plus intensive low-salt diet education. The final analyses was performed with 245 completed patients.
AB  - RESULTS: The amount of daily albuminuria was significantly decreased from 0 (566.0 [25.0-5398.6] mg/d) to 8 weeks (282.5 [16.1-4898.5] mg/d; P<0.001). From 8 to 16 weeks, the 24-hour urinary sodium excretion was decreased by 36.0+/-5.9 mmol/d in the intensive education group and 8.8+/-4.9 mmol/d in the conventional education group (interaction P<0.001). Patients who completed intensive low-salt diet education exhibited greater decreases in urinary albumin excretion than the control group (change in albuminuria from 8 to 16 weeks, -154.0 versus 0.4 mg/d; P=0.01). Urinary albumin excretion tended to decrease as the 24-hour urinary sodium excretion amount decreased (R=0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.20 to 0.43; P<0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The 24-hour urinary albumin excretion was decreased more in patients in the intensive low-salt diet education group than patients in the conventional education group. Weekly intensive education on a low-salt diet would be a suitable method for clinical practice.Copyright © 2014 by the American Society of Nephrology.

TI  - Improved retention rates with low-cost interventions in hypertension and diabetes management in a rural African environment of nurse-led care: a cluster-randomised trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of low-level facility-based interventions on patient retention rates for cardiovascular (CV) disease in an environment of task shifting and nurse-led care in rural health districts in Central Cameroon.
AB  - METHODS: This study is an open-label, three-arm, cluster-randomised trial in nurse-led facilities. All three groups implemented a treatment contract. The control group (group 1) had no additional intervention, group 2 received the incentive of 1 month of free treatment every forth month of regularly respected visits, and group 3 received reminder letters in case of a missed follow-up visit. The primary outcome was patient retention at 1 year. Secondary outcomes were adherence to follow-up visit schemes and changes in blood pressure (BP) and blood glucose levels. Patients' monthly spending for drugs and transport was calculated retrospectively.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 33 centres and 221 patients were included. After 1 year, 109 patients (49.3%) remained in the programme. Retention rates in groups 2 and 3 were 60% and 65%, respectively, against 29% in the control group. The differences between the intervention groups and the control group were significant (P < 0.001), but differences between the two intervention groups were not (P = 0.719). There were no significant differences in BP or fasting plasma glucose trends between retained patients in the study groups. Average monthly cost to patients for antihypertensive medication was  1.1 +/- 0.9 and for diabetics 1.2 +/- 1.1. Transport costs to the centres were on average 1.1 +/- 1.0 for hypertensive patients and 1.1 +/- 1.6 for patients with diabetes.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Low-cost interventions suited to an environment of task shifting and nurse-led care and needing minimal additional resources can significantly improve retention rates in CV disease management in rural Africa. The combination of a treatment contract and reminder letters in case of missed appointments was an effective measure to retain patients in care.Copyright © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - A trial for the use of qigong in the treatment of pre and mild essential hypertension: a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and the prevalence of hypertension tends to increase with age. Current treatments for hypertension have side effects and poor adherence. Qigong has been studied as an alternative therapy for hypertension; however, the types of qigong used in those studies were diverse, and there have not been many well-designed randomized controlled trials.Our objectives are the following: 1) To evaluate the effects of qigong on blood pressure, health status and hormone levels for pre- or mild hypertension. 2) To test the methodological appropriateness of this clinical trial and calculate a sample size for future randomized trials.
AB  - METHODS: Forty subjects with pre- or mild hypertension will be randomized to either the qigong exercise group or the non-treated group. Participants in the qigong group will conduct qigong exercises 5 times per week for 8 weeks, and participants in the non-treated group will maintain their current lifestyle, including diet and exercise. The use of antihypertensive medication is not permitted. The primary endpoint is a change in patient blood pressure. Secondary endpoints are patient health status (as measured by the SF-36 and the MYMOP2 questionnaires) and changes in hormone levels, including norepinephrine, epinephrine, and cortisol.
AB  - DISCUSSION: This study will be the first randomized trial to investigate the effectiveness of qigong exercises for the treatment of pre- and mild hypertension. The results of this study will help to establish the optimal approach for the care of adults with pre- or mild hypertension.

TI  - Cardiovascular risk factors control in Polish patients with type 2 diabetes within the first two years of diagnosis: results of the ARETAEUS1 study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The practice guidelines of cardiological and diabetological societies emphasise that cardiovascular (CV) risk control in diabetic patients is especially important and should be stricter than in subjects without diabetes. There are little data on the frequency of meeting treatment goals in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2).
AB  - AIM: To characterise Polish patients with DM2 diagnosed within the previous two years and to assess if the treatment targets from the current (2008) guidelines of Diabetes Poland regarding control of CV risk factors are met.
AB  - METHODS: ARETAEUS1 was a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study conducted in various regions of Poland in 2009 (January-April). It involved 1,714 patients of all ages and both genders, who had DM2 treated for less than 24 months. They were recruited by randomly selected physicians.
AB  - RESULTS: Total cholesterol treatment goal (< 4.5 mmol/L) was met in 22% of all patients, triglycerides treatment goal (< 1.7 mmol/L) in 44%, LDL cholesterol treatment goal (< 2.6 mmol/L) in 20% and HDL cholesterol treatment goal (> 1.0 mmol/L in men and > 1.3 mmol/L in women) in 55%. Only 13% of the overall population met the goal of blood pressure (BP) below 130/80 mm Hg. When a less restrictive BP control threshold (< 140/90 mm Hg) was applied, 48% of patients had their BP below the threshold. In the analysis of subgroups (patients with and without previous CV events; receiving 1-5 or not receiving antihypertensive drugs; receiving and not receiving statins and fibrates) we observed from 0% to 3.3% of patients meeting three (HbA1c, BP and cholesterol) treatment goals. The percentages of patients meeting two out of three treatment goals were between 8% and 33% in different subgroups. The percentages of patients meeting only one out of three treatment goals ranged from 27.8% to 46.7% or at least one - from 39% to 69%.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with newly diagnosed diabetes are not meeting their treatment goals regarding control of CV risk factors, which indicates relatively low adherence to national guideline recommendations for diabetes control and primary CV prevention in DM2. Difficulties in achieving CV treatment targets in the diabetic population indicate the need for a great deal of effort on the part of clinicians and patients. Practice guidelines developers should consider what treatment targets are achievable at a reasonable expense of effort.

TI  - The effect of medical nutrition therapy on changes in dietary knowledge and DASH diet adherence in older adults with cardiovascular disease.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of MNT on dietary knowledge of older adults at baseline, 6 months and 12 months and to assess the effect of dietary knowledge on change in DASH diet adherence from baseline to 12 months.
AB  - DESIGN: Data for the analysis come from a controlled, randomized prospective design conducted from 2003-2005 with the outcome measures taken pre-, mid-, and post-intervention.
AB  - SETTING: Data were collected from participants in their homes in an urban community in North Carolina.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Participants (N=147) were adults aged 60+ with a diagnosis of hypertension and/or hyperlipidemia.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Intervention recipients received three sessions of MNT throughout the 1 year study period. The control group received nutrition information at enrollment.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: Participants completed a dietary knowledge questionnaire and a 24 dietary recall at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Instrumental variables models with participant fixed effects were used to determine the impact of MNT on dietary knowledge and dietary knowledge on DASH diet adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: Among those who received MNT, dietary knowledge increased from baseline to twelve months (p<.01). Changes in dietary knowledge were not associated with changes in DASH adherence from baseline to 12 months (p=0.44).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The MNT administered was effective at improving dietary knowledge, but not at improving DASH adherence. Three MNT sessions may be insufficient to change behavior. Integrating behavioral change theory and cultural sensitivity to MNT may improve diet adherence among diverse older adults.

TI  - Community Outreach and Cardiovascular Health (COACH) Trial: a randomized, controlled trial of nurse practitioner/community health worker cardiovascular disease risk reduction in urban community health centers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite well-publicized guidelines on the appropriate management of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, the implementation of risk-reducing practices remains poor. This report describes the results of a randomized, controlled clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness of a comprehensive program of cardiovascular disease risk reduction delivered by nurse practitioner /community health worker (NP/CHW) teams versus enhanced usual care (EUC) to improve lipids, blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and patient perceptions of the quality of their chronic illness care in patients in urban community health centers.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 525 patients with documented cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or hypertension and levels of LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, or HbA1c that exceeded goals established by national guidelines were randomly assigned to NP/CHW (n=261) or EUC (n=264) groups. The NP/CHW intervention included aggressive pharmacological management and tailored educational and behavioral counseling for lifestyle modification and problem solving to address barriers to adherence and control. Compared with EUC, patients in the NP/CHW group had significantly greater 12-month improvement in total cholesterol (difference, 19.7 mg/dL), LDL cholesterol (difference,15.9 mg/dL), triglycerides (difference, 16.3 mg/dL), systolic blood pressure (difference, 6.2 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (difference, 3.1 mm Hg), HbA1c (difference, 0.5%), and perceptions of the quality of their chronic illness care (difference, 1.2 points).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: An intervention delivered by an NP/CHW team using individualized treatment regimens based on treat-to-target algorithms can be an effective approach to improve risk factor status and perceptions of chronic illness care in high-risk patients.

TI  - Comparison of primary care models in the prevention of cardiovascular disease - a cross sectional study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary care providers play an important role in preventing and managing cardiovascular disease. This study compared the quality of preventive cardiovascular care delivery amongst different primary care models.
AB  - METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a larger randomized control trial, known as the Improved Delivery of Cardiovascular Care (IDOCC) through Outreach Facilitation. Using baseline data collected through IDOCC, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 82 primary care practices from three delivery models in Eastern Ontario, Canada: 43 fee-for-service, 27 blended-capitation and 12 community health centres with salary-based physicians. Medical chart audits from 4,808 patients with or at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease were used to examine each practice's adherence to ten evidence-based processes of care for diabetes, chronic kidney disease, dyslipidemia, hypertension, weight management, and smoking cessation care. Generalized estimating equation models adjusting for age, sex, rurality, number of cardiovascular-related comorbidities, and year of data collection were used to compare guideline adherence amongst the three models.
AB  - RESULTS: The percentage of patients with diabetes that received two hemoglobin A1c tests during the study year was significantly higher in community health centres (69%) than in fee-for-service (45%) practices (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 2.4 [95% CI 1.4-4.2], p = 0.001). Blended capitation practices had a significantly higher percentage of patients who had their waistlines monitored than in fee-for-service practices (19% vs. 5%, AOR = 3.7 [1.8-7.8], p = 0.0006), and who were recommended a smoking cessation drug when compared to community health centres (33% vs. 16%, AOR = 2.4 [1.3-4.6], p = 0.007). Overall, quality of diabetes care was higher in community health centres, while smoking cessation care and weight management was higher in the blended-capitation models. Fee-for-service practices had the greatest gaps in care, most noticeably in diabetes care and weight management.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the evidence suggesting that primary care delivery model impacts quality of care. These findings support current Ontario reforms to move away from the traditional fee-for-service practice.

TI  - Design, rationale, and baseline characteristics of a cluster randomized controlled trial of pay for performance for hypertension treatment: study protocol.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite compelling evidence of the benefits of treatment and well-accepted guidelines for treatment, hypertension is controlled in less than one-half of United States citizens.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: This randomized controlled trial tests whether explicit financial incentives promote the translation of guideline-recommended care for hypertension into clinical practice and improve blood pressure (BP) control in the primary care setting. Using constrained randomization, we assigned 12 Veterans Affairs hospital outpatient clinics to four study arms: physician-level incentive; group-level incentive; combination of physician and group incentives; and no incentives (control). All participants at the hospital (cluster) were assigned to the same study arm. We enrolled 83 full-time primary care physicians and 42 non-physician personnel. The intervention consisted of an educational session about guideline-recommended care for hypertension, five audit and feedback reports, and five disbursements of incentive payments. Incentive payments rewarded participants for chart-documented use of guideline-recommended antihypertensive medications, BP control, and appropriate responses to uncontrolled BP during a prior four-month performance period over the 20-month intervention. To identify potential unintended consequences of the incentives, the study team interviewed study participants, as well as non-participant primary care personnel and leadership at study sites. Chart reviews included data collection on quality measures not related to hypertension. To evaluate the persistence of the effect of the incentives, the study design includes a washout period.
AB  - DISCUSSION: We briefly describe the rationale for the interventions being studied, as well as the major design choices. Rigorous research designs such as the one described here are necessary to determine whether performance-based payment arrangements such as financial incentives result in meaningful quality improvements.

TI  - A randomized trial to improve patient-centered care and hypertension control in underserved primary care patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: African Americans and persons with low socioeconomic status (SES) are disproportionately affected by hypertension and receive less patient-centered care than less vulnerable patient populations. Moreover, continuing medical education (CME) and patient-activation interventions have infrequently been directed to improve the processes of care for these populations.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of patient-centered interventions targeting patients and physicians with the effectiveness of minimal interventions for underserved groups.
AB  - DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial conducted from January 2002 through August 2005, with patient follow-up at 3 and 12 months, in 14 urban, community-based practices in Baltimore, Maryland.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Forty-one primary care physicians and 279 hypertension patients.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Physician communication skills training and patient coaching by community health workers.
AB  - MAIN MEASURES: Physician communication behaviors; patient ratings of physicians' participatory decision-making (PDM), patient involvement in care (PIC), reported adherence to medications; systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) and BP control.
AB  - KEY RESULTS: Visits of trained versus control group physicians demonstrated more positive communication change scores from baseline (-0.52 vs. -0.82, p = 0.04). At 12 months, the patient+physician intensive group compared to the minimal intervention group showed significantly greater improvements in patient report of physicians' PDM (beta = +6.20 vs. -5.24, p = 0.03) and PIC dimensions related to doctor facilitation (beta = +0.22 vs. -0.17, p = 0.03) and information exchange (beta = +0.32 vs. -0.22, p = 0.005). Improvements in patient adherence and BP control did not differ across groups for the overall patient sample. However, among patients with uncontrolled hypertension at baseline, non-significant reductions in systolic BP were observed among patients in all intervention groups-the patient+physician intensive (-13.2 mmHg), physician intensive/patient minimal (-10.6 mmHg), and the patient intensive/physician minimal (-16.8 mmHg), compared to the patient+physician minimal group (-2.0 mmHg).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Interventions that enhance physicians' communication skills and activate patients to participate in their care positively affect patient-centered communication, patient perceptions of engagement in care, and may improve systolic BP among urban African-American and low SES patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

TI  - Measurement of adherence to brimonidine therapy for glaucoma using electronic monitoring.
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the patient adherence and behavior with brimonidine twice daily (bid) or 3 times daily (tid) in patients used to topical glaucoma medication.
AB  - PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-five patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension were enrolled in a prospective, observational cohort study. Consenting patients were randomly assigned to brimonidine bid or tid and received conventional brimonidine eye drops with attached electronic monitoring devices for 4 weeks. Patients were not explicitly informed on the compliance monitoring.
AB  - RESULTS: The study was completed by 67 patients (89%). In 65 patients (97%), at least 1 dosing interval exceeded 24 hours. The mean adherence rates were better in the brimonidine bid group (72 +/- 19% vs. 62 +/- 16%, P=0.04), although dosing frequency was higher in the tid group (1.9 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.4 +/- 0.4 per day; P<0.001). On average medication coverage was 70% for the bid group and 67% for the tid group; 19 patients (28%) had a coverage rate above 75%, 42 patients (63%) 50% to 75%, and 6 (9%) below 50%. Patients with normal-tension glaucoma had lower coverage rates than patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension (P<0.05). Data also showed that on average 20% of the glaucoma medication was wasted owing to inefficient drug delivery by using more than 1 drop per dosing.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Individual adherence with brimonidine was highly variable and pharmacologically insufficient for more than two-third of the patients. Special attention should be paid to compliance of patients with normal-tension glaucoma. Our findings underline the need to improve individual adherence and drug delivery in topical glaucoma therapy.

TI  - Prospective analysis of LDL-C goal achievement and self-reported medication adherence among statin users in primary care.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Improvements in the control of LDL-C levels have occurred in the past decade due to the introduction of increasingly potent statins, such as atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. Many patients, however, do not achieve their LDL-C goals, which presents a practical dilemma for clinicians and highlights the need to identify adherence problems in a clinically relevant manner.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between LDL-C goal achievement and both medication adherence and beliefs assessed using structured questioning.
AB  - METHODS: All patients were aged >40 years and participated in the cardiovascular risk factor management program STOP-HF (St. Vincent's Screening To Prevent Heart Failure study). One hundred and eighty-five participants who had been prescribed statins, split between those who achieved and those who did not achieve LDL-C goal, were randomly selected for a prospective study examining the relationship between adherence, assessed by the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS), and LDL-C goal achievement. Patients' beliefs about medicines were assessed using the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire-General (BMQ-G). Main outcome measures were predictors of LDL-C goal achievement and medication adherence and predictors of adherence among patients using the MMAS.
AB  - RESULTS: The average age of the selected patients was 64.9 (9.9) years; 45% were male, 46% had hypertension, 17.5% had coronary artery disease, and 10% had diabetes. Questionnaires were answered by 119 patients, 71 of whom (59.7%) were goal achievers. LDL-C goal achievers were more likely to respond to the questionnaires than nonachievers (76.8% vs 52.7%; P = 0.002). Fifty-eight respondents (48.7%) reported that they were not fully adherent to medication and in multivariable analysis were twice as likely to miss LDL-C goal compared with those who were adherent. Approximately 25% of patients who reported nonadherence were intentionally so. Patients' beliefs about medicines were a significant predictor of self-reported adherence but not of LDL-C goal achievement.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Medication nonadherence may be responsible for failure to achieve goal in many patients who are prescribed statins. In routine clinical care, the structured MMAS questionnaire may provide clinicians with an effective tool to assess medication nonadherence in the context of statin therapy failure.

TI  - Non-pharmacological treatment of hypertension in primary health care: a comparative clinical trial of two education strategies in health and nutrition.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor adherence to non-pharmacological treatment of hypertension represents a serious challenge for public health policies in several countries. This study was conducted to compare two intervention strategies regarding the adherence of adult women to dietary changes recommended for the treatment of hypertension in a community covered by Primary Health Care Unit.
AB  - METHODS: This study is a randomized controlled trial of a sample composed of 28 women with hypertension enrolled in the Primary Health Care Unit located in the urban area of southeastern Brazil. The participants were already undergoing treatment for hypertension but devoid of nutritional care; and were divided into two groups, each composed of 14 individuals, who received interventions that consisted of two different strategies of nutritional guidance: monthly health education workshops alone (Group 1) and combined with family orientation through home visits (Group 2). Adherence to nutritional guidelines was evaluated by dietary, anthropometric, clinical and serum biochemical parameters, measured before and after the interventions. Knowledge on control and risk of hypertension was also investigated. The study lasted five months.
AB  - RESULTS: Mean age was 55.6 (+/- 2.8) and 50.7 (+/- 6.5) in the groups 1 and 2, respectively. The home orientation strategy promoted greater adherence to dietary changes, leading to a statistically significant improvement in the clinical, anthropometric, biochemical and dietary parameters. The group 2 reduced the consumption of risk foods (p = 0.01), oil (p = 0.002) and sugar (p = 0.02), and decreased body mass index (-0.7 kg/m2; p = 0.01); waist circumference (-4.2 cm; p = 0.001), systolic blood pressure (-13 mm HG; p = 0.004) and glycemia (-18.9 mg/dl; p = 0. 01). In group 1 only waist circumference (-2 cm; p = 0.01) changed significantly.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Nutritional orientations at the household level were more effective with regard to the adherence of individuals to non-pharmacological treatment of hypertension, regarding the reduction of clinical and behavioral risk parameters.

TI  - [Efficacy of fixed combination amlodipine/valsartan in hospitalized patients with hypertensive disease]. [Russian]
AB  - Efficacy and tolerability of fixed amlodipine/valsartan combination was studied in 86 patients with hypertensive disease hospitalized in departments of general internal medicine or cardiology. All patients had indications for antihypertensive therapy and were randomized either to fixed combination amlodipine/valsartan (n=43) or to therapy which corresponded to the hospital formulary (n=43). Correction of antihypertensive therapy was performed by treating physician at daily rounds. Self-control of blood pressure (BP) was performed by patients with the use of UA767PC apparatus. Results of BP self-control were compared with clinical measurements in order to detect concealed inefficacy of treatment. Results. Rate of achievement of target BP with fixed combination amlodipine/valsartan (93%) was comparable with that on traditional therapy (90%). But the use of fixed combination amlodipine/valsartan compared with traditional therapy was associated with lower clinical and self measured BP, quicker achievement of target BP (5.8+/-2.3 and 9.2+/-1.8 days, respectively, p<0.05), lesser number of antihypertensive drugs (2.5+/-0.6 and 3.0+/-0.9 days, respectively), lower rate of concealed inefficacy of treatment (12 and 31%, respectively, p<0.05). Conclusions. We have demonstrated appropriateness of inhospital administration of fixed amlodipine/valsartan combination as an approach allowing to achieve target BP in shorter time, with the use of fewer antihypertensive drugs, and diminishing concealed inefficacy of treatment.

TI  - Combination therapy as initial treatment for newly diagnosed hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommends that clinicians consider the use of multidrug therapy to increase likelihood of achieving blood pressure goal. Little is known about recent patterns of combination antihypertensive therapy use in patients being initiated on hypertension treatment.
AB  - METHODS: We investigated combination antihypertensive therapy use in newly diagnosed hypertensive patients from the Cardiovascular Research Network Hypertension Registry. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between combination antihypertensive therapy and 12-month blood pressure control.
AB  - RESULTS: Between 2002 and 2007, a total of 161,585 patients met criteria for incident hypertension and were initiated on treatment. During the study period, an increasing proportion of patients were treated initially with combination rather than with single-agent therapy (20.7% in 2002 compared with 35.8% in 2007, P < .001). This increase in combination therapy use was more pronounced in patients with stage 2 hypertension, whose combination therapy use increased from 21.6% in 2002 to 44.5% in 2007. Nearly 90% of initial combination therapy was accounted for by 2 combinations, a thiazide and a potassium-sparing diuretic (47.6%) and a thiazide and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (41.4%). After controlling for relevant clinical factors, including subsequent intensification of treatment and medication adherence, combination therapy was associated with increased odds of blood pressure control at 12 months (odds ratio compared with single-drug initial therapy 1.20; 95% CI 1.15-1.24, P < .001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Initial treatment of hypertension with combination therapy is increasingly common and is associated with better long-term blood pressure control.Copyright © 2011 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Improving adherence with amlodipine/atorvastatin therapy: IMPACT study.[Erratum appears in J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich). 2011 Oct;13(10):784 Note: Nesbitt, Shawna [added]]
AB  - Hypertension is prevalent in the United States and remains uncontrolled. The primary objective of the study was to determine the effect of once-daily dosing of a combination therapy for blood pressure (BP) and dyslipidemia using home BP monitoring on reaching clinical BP and the effect of daily dosing of combination therapy on reaching lipid goals. The study was conducted in middle-aged, indigent, African Americans who had high-risk, resistant hypertension and dyslipidemia. Patients were randomly assigned to either the home and clinic BP group or usual care group and were followed for 6 months. The average BPs for each group were compared and used to titrate the study drug appropriately. Both groups achieved significant declines in BP, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (P<.0001). These findings demonstrate that BP control could be achieved at a rate of 43.5% compared with the 2004 national control rate of 35%. The LDL control rate was also improved. Cardiovascular risk reduction has been proven to be achieved through managing lipids and BP. This trial demonstrates that these goals can be achieved similar to other groups in indigent African Americans with high-risk hypertension and dyslipidemia.Copyright © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - The "10 keys" to healthy aging: 24-month follow-up results from an innovative community-based prevention program.
AB  - The purpose of this report was to evaluate a prevention program to reduce risk factors for common diseases among older individuals in a lower income community. This randomized community-based study enrolled older adults into a Brief Education and Counseling Intervention or a Brief Education and Counseling Intervention plus a physical activity and (for those with hypertension) a dietary sodium intervention. Outcomes were collected on 389 adults with a mean age of 73.9 years over 24 months. Adherence to the "10 Keys" improved significantly in the proportion meeting goals for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (+14%), bone mineral density testing (+11%), pneumonia vaccination (+11%), colonoscopy (+14%), and adherence to antihypertensive medication (+9%). This program resulted in significant reductions in key risk factors, increases in immunizations, and adherence to established prevention guidelines over 2 years. Further research is needed to refine the use of community health counselors for translating prevention knowledge into community settings. A major limitation of these studies is the low participation percentage.

TI  - Effect of a 36-month pharmaceutical care program on pharmacotherapy adherence in elderly diabetic and hypertensive patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a pharmaceutical care program on pharmacotherapy adherence in elderly diabetic and hypertensive patients. The clinical outcomes of this pharmacotherapy adherence approach were the secondary objective of the study.
AB  - SETTING: Public Primary Health Care Unit in a municipality in the Brazilian State of Sao Paulo.
AB  - METHOD: A 36-month randomized, controlled, prospective clinical trial was carried out with 200 patients divided into two groups: control (n = 100) and intervention (n = 100). The control group received the usual care offered by the Primary Health Care Unit (medical and nurse consultancies). The patients randomized into the intervention group received pharmaceutical care intervention besides the usual care offered.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Pharmacotherapy adherence (Morisky-Green test translated into Portuguese and computerized dispensed medication history) and clinical measurements (blood pressure, fasting glucose, A1C hemoglobin, triglycerides and total cholesterol) were evaluated at the baseline and up to 36 months. A P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 97 patients from the intervention group and 97 patients from the control group completed the study (n = 194). Significant improvements in the pharmacotherapy adherence were verified for the intervention group according to the Morisky-Green test (50.5% of adherent patients at baseline vs. 83.5% of adherent patients after 36 months; P < 0.001) and the computerized dispensed medication history (52.6% of adherent patients at baseline vs. 83.5% of adherent patients after 36 months; P < 0.001); no significant changes were verified in the control group. Significant improvements in the number of patients reaching adequate values for their blood pressure (26.8% at baseline vs. 86.6% after 36-months; P < 0.001), fasting glucose (29.9% at baseline vs. 70.1% after 36 months; P < 0.001), A1C hemoglobin (3.3% at baseline vs. 63.3% after 36 months; P < 0.001), triglycerides (47.4% at baseline vs. 74.2% after 36 months; P < 0.001) and total cholesterol (59.8% at baseline vs. 80.4% after 36 months; P = 0.002) were verified in the intervention group, but remained unchanged in the control group.
AB  - CONCLUSION: These results indicated the effectiveness of pharmaceutical care in improving pharmacotherapy adherence, with positive effects in the clinical outcomes of the patients studied.

TI  - A multimodal blood pressure control intervention in 3 healthcare systems.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if a multimodal intervention composed of patient education, home blood pressure (BP) monitoring, BP measurement reporting to an interactive voice response (IVR) phone system, and clinical pharmacist follow-up improves BP control compared with usual care.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study with patient enrollment, medication consultation and adjustment, remote BP monitoring, and follow-up at 6 months.
AB  - METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted at 3 healthcare systems in Denver, Colorado, including a large health maintenance organization, a Veterans Affairs medical center, and a county hospital. At each site, patients with uncontrolled BP were randomized to the multimodal intervention vs usual care for 6 months, with the primary end point of BP reduction.
AB  - RESULTS: Of 338 patients randomized, 283 (84%) completed the study, including 138 intervention patients and 145 usual care patients. Baseline BP was higher in the intervention group vs the usual care group (150.5/89.4 vs 143.8/85.3 mm Hg). At 6 months, BPs were similar in the intervention group vs the usual care group (137.4 vs 136.7 mm Hg, P = .85 for systolic; 82.9 vs 81.1 mm Hg, P = .14 for diastolic). However, BP reductions were greater in the intervention group vs the usual care group (-13.1 vs -7.1 mm Hg, P = .006 for systolic; -6.5 vs -4.2 mm Hg, P = .07 for diastolic). Adherence to medications was similar between the 2 groups, but intervention patients had a greater increase in medication regimen intensity.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A multimodal intervention of patient education, home BP monitoring, BP measurement reporting to an IVR system, and clinical pharmacist follow-up achieved greater reductions in BP compared with usual care.

TI  - Effect of a 36-month pharmaceutical care program on the coronary heart disease risk in elderly diabetic and hypertensive patients.
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the effect of a pharmaceutical care program on the coronary heart disease risk in elderly diabetic and hypertensive patients.
AB  - METHODS: A total of 200 elderly (> 60 years) diabetic and/or hypertensive patients were recruited into a randomized, controlled, prospective clinical trial with a 36-month follow-up, developed in a public primary health care unit in a municipality in the Brazilian State of Sao Paulo. A range of clinical measurements were evaluated at the baseline and up to 36 months afterwards. The intervention group patients received pharmaceutical care from a clinical pharmacist, whereas the control group patients received their usual care from the medical and nursing staff. The Framingham scoring method was used to estimate changes in the 10-year coronary heart disease risk scores of all the patients.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 194 patients completed the study. Significant reductions (p < 0.05) in the mean values (baseline vs. 36 months) for the systolic blood pressure [156.7 mmHg vs 133.7 mmHg; P < 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (106.6 mmHg vs. 91.6 mmHg; P < 0.001),fasting glucose (135.1 mg/dL vs. 107.9 mg/dL; P < 0.001), hemoglobin A1C (7.7% vs. 7.0%; P <0.001), triglycerides (206.0 mg/dL vs. 152.5 mg/dL; P < 0.001), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)cholesterol (112.4 mg/dL vs. 102.0 mg/dL; P < 0.001), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (55.5 mg/dL vs. 65.5 mg/dL; P < 0.001), total cholesterol (202.5 mg/dL vs. 185.9 mg/dL; P < 0.001), body mass index (26.2 kg/m2 vs. 26.1 kg/m2; P < 0.001), and abdominal circumference (103.2 cm vs. 102.5 cm; P= 0.001) were observed in the intervention group, whereas no significant changes were verified in the control group. The mean Framingham risk prediction score in the intervention group was 6.8% at baseline and decreased to 4.5%; P < 0.001) after 36 months, but remained unchanged in the control group.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The pharmaceutical care program resulted in better clinical measurements and reduced the cardiovascular risk scores in elderly diabetic and hypertensive patients over a 36-month period.

TI  - Medication adherence among rural, low-income hypertensive adults: a randomized trial of a multimedia community-based intervention.
AB  - PURPOSE: Examine the effectiveness of a community-based, multimedia intervention on medication adherence among hypertensive adults.
AB  - DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.
AB  - SETTING: Rural south Alabama.
AB  - SUBJECTS: Low-income adults (N  =  434) receiving medication at no charge from a public health department or a Federally Qualified Health Center.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Both interventions were home-based and delivered via computer by a community health advisor. The adherence promotion (AP) intervention focused on theoretical variables related to adherence (e.g., barriers, decisional balance, and role models). The cancer control condition received general cancer information.
AB  - MEASURES: Adherence was assessed by pill count. Other adherence-related variables, including barriers, self-efficacy, depression, and sociodemographic variables, were collected via a telephone survey.
AB  - ANALYSIS: Chi-square analysis tested the hypothesis that a greater proportion of participants in the AP intervention are >80% adherent compared to the control group. General linear modeling examined adherence as a continuous variable.
AB  - RESULTS: Participants receiving the intervention did not differ from individuals in the control group (51% vs. 49% adherent, respectively; p  =  .67). Clinic type predicted adherence (p < .0001), as did forgetting to take medications (p  =  .01) and difficulty getting to the clinic to obtain medications (p < .001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Multilevel interventions that focus on individual behavior and community-level targets (e.g., how health care is accessed and delivered) may be needed to improve medication adherence among low-income rural residents.

TI  - Adherence with brimonidine in patients with glaucoma aware and not aware of electronic monitoring.
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the impact of open versus masked adherence monitoring on adherence with topical brimonidine using two different dosing schedules.
AB  - METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension were enrolled in a prospective, observational cohort study. Patients were randomly assigned to open or masked adherence monitoring and to brimonidine twice daily (BID) or three times daily (TID). Patients received conventional brimonidine eye drops with attached electronic monitoring devices for 4 weeks with weekly intraocular pressure measurements. Adherence calculations comprised dosing intervals, adherence rate and time covered. Subgroup analysis with anova included the factors masking, regimen, diagnosis and age.
AB  - RESULTS: Among 36 individually analysed patients, 12 (33%) had adherence rates above 75%, therein two (5%)>90%. The mean adherence rate in 19 patients aware of adherence measurements was 70 +/- 17% for brimonidine BID and 65 +/- 14% for TID, not significantly different to the rates of 17 patients not informed about adherence measurements (77 +/- 6% BID, 62 +/- 9% TID, p = 0.24). On average, patients with brimonidine TID achieved significantly lower adherence rates (64 +/- 12%) than patients on BID (73 +/- 13%, p = 0.02). Still, patients on TID applied brimonidine more often (TID 1.9 +/- 0.3, BID 1.5 +/- 0.1 mean applications per day). The median coverage was 70% and showed no statistically significant difference between patients on BID and TID (p = 0.36).
AB  - CONCLUSION: The study findings suggest that adherence measurements are not significantly altered by open adherence monitoring, which may simplify future adherence studies. Adherence with brimonidine eye drops was insufficient for most patients. These results demonstrate the necessity to develop new strategies to improve compliance in glaucoma therapy.Copyright © 2010 The Authors.

TI  - Effectiveness of home telehealth in comorbid diabetes and hypertension: a randomized, controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased emphasis is being placed on the critical need to control hypertension (HTN) in patients with diabetes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a nurse-managed home telehealth intervention to improve outcomes in veterans with comorbid diabetes and HTN.
AB  - DESIGN: A single-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial design comparing two remote monitoring intensity levels and usual care in patients with type 2 diabetes and HTN being treated in primary care was used.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcomes were hemoglobin A1c and systolic blood pressure (SBP); secondary outcome was adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: Intervention subjects experienced decreased A1c during the 6-month intervention period compared with the control group, but 6 months after the intervention was withdrawn, the intervention groups were comparable with the control group. For SBP, the high-intensity subjects had a significant decrease in SBP compared with the other groups at 6 months and this pattern was maintained at 12 months. Adherence improved over time for all groups, but there were no differences among the three groups.
AB  - LIMITATIONS: Subjects had relatively good baseline control for A1c and SBP; minorities and women were underrepresented.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Home telehealth provides an innovative and pragmatic approach to enhance earlier detection of key clinical symptoms requiring intervention. Transmission of education and advice to the patient on an ongoing basis with close surveillance by nurses can improve clinical outcomes in patients with comorbid chronic illness.

TI  - Limitations of analyses based on achieved blood pressure: lessons from the African American study of kidney disease and hypertension trial.
AB  - Blood pressure (BP) guidelines that set target BP levels often rely on analyses of achieved BP from hypertension treatment trials. The objective of this article was to compare the results of analyses of achieved BP to intention-to-treat analyses on renal disease progression. Participants (n=1094) in the African-American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension Trial were randomly assigned to either usual BP goal defined by a mean arterial pressure goal of 102 to 107 mm Hg or lower BP goal defined by a mean arterial pressure goal of <92 mm Hg. Median follow-up was 3.7 years. Primary outcomes were rate of decline in measured glomerular filtration rate and a composite of a decrease in glomerular filtration rate by >50% or >25 mL/min per 1.73 m(2), requirement for dialysis, transplantation, or death. Intention-to-treat analyses showed no evidence of a BP effect on either the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate or the clinical composite outcome. In contrast, the achieved BP analyses showed that each 10-mm Hg increment in mean follow-up achieved mean arterial pressure was associated with a 0.35 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) (95% CI: 0.08 to 0.62 mL/min per 1.73 m(2); P=0.01) faster mean glomerular filtration rate decline and a 17% (95% CI: 5% to 32%; P=0.006) increased risk of the clinical composite outcome. Analyses based on achieved BP lead to markedly different inferences than traditional intention-to-treat analyses, attributed in part to confounding of achieved BP with comorbidities, disease severity, and adherence. Clinicians and policy makers should exercise caution when making treatment recommendations based on analyses relating outcomes to achieved BP.

TI  - Secondary prevention risk interventions via telemedicine and tailored patient education (SPRITE): a randomized trial to improve postmyocardial infarction management.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Secondary prevention by risk factor modification improves patient outcomes, yet it is often not achieved in clinical practice. Reasons for failure stem from challenges of prioritizing risk factor reduction and engaging patients in changing their behaviors. We hypothesize that a novel telemedicine intervention with tailored patient education could improve cardiovascular risk factors.
AB  - METHODS: To evaluate this intervention, we propose enrolling 450 patients with a recent myocardial infarction and hypertension into a 3-arm randomized, controlled trial. The first arm (n=150) will receive home blood pressure (BP) monitors plus a nurse-delivered, telephone-based tailored patient education intervention and will be enrolled into HealthVault, a Microsoft electronic health record platform. The second arm (n=150) will also receive BP monitors plus a tailored patient education intervention and be enrolled in HeartVault. However, the patient education intervention will be delivered by a Web-based program and will cover topics identical to those in the nurse-delivered intervention. Both arms will be compared with a control group receiving standard care (n=150). All participants will have an in-person assessment at baseline and at completion of the study, including standardized measurements of BP, LDL cholesterol, and glycosylated hemoglobin (in diabetic subjects). The study design will allow assessment of a telephone-based, nurse-administered disease management program versus standard care. The main outcome of interest is the reduction in systolic BP in each intervention group compared with the control group at 12 months. Secondary outcomes assessed will include reductions in LDL cholesterol, body weight, and glycosylated hemoglobin, as well as adherence to evidence-based therapies and improvement in health behaviors.
AB  - CONCLUSION: If successful in optimizing BP control, managing other coronary heart disease risk factors, and demonstrating a lower cost, the Web-based disease management tool has the potential to enhance coronary artery disease management, quality of care, and ultimately, patient outcomes.

TI  - Randomized, controlled trial of an intervention to enable stroke survivors throughout the Los Angeles County safety net to "stay with the guidelines".
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability. Inpatient programs optimize secondary stroke prevention care at the time of hospital discharge, but such care may not be continued after hospital discharge.
AB  - METHODS: To improve the delivery of secondary stroke preventive services after hospital discharge, we have designed a chronic care model-based program called SUSTAIN (Systemic Use of STroke Averting INterventions). This care intervention includes group clinics, self-management support, report cards, decision support through care guides and protocols, and coordination of ongoing care. The first specific aim is to test, in a randomized, controlled trial, whether SUSTAIN improves blood pressure control among an analytic sample of 268 patients with a recent stroke or transient ischemic attack discharged from 4 Los Angeles County public hospitals. Secondary outcomes consist of control of other stroke risk factors, lifestyle habits, medication adherence, patient perceptions of care quality, functional status, and quality of life. A second specific aim is to conduct a cost analysis of SUSTAIN from the perspective of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services by using direct costs of the intervention, cost equivalents of associated utilization of county system resources, and cost equivalents of the observed and predicted averted vascular events.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: If SUSTAIN is effective, we will have the expertise and findings to advocate for its continued support at Los Angeles County hospitals and to disseminate the SUSTAIN program to other settings serving indigent, minority populations.

TI  - Knowledge and adherence to antihypertensive therapy in primary care: results of a randomized trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of a healthcare education program for patients with hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: A multicenter, prospective, cluster-randomized trial was conducted. Randomization was by primary care center; 18 of 36 urban primary care centers in Barcelona and its metropolitan area were randomized to the intervention group (IG) and 18 to the control group (CG). The study sample consisted of patients with hypertension (n=996; 515 in the IG and 481 in the CG) receiving outpatient treatment with antihypertensive drugs. The intervention consisted of personalized information by a trained nurse and written leaflets. Questionnaires on knowledge and awareness of hypertension and its medication, treatment adherence, healthy lifestyle habits, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and body mass index were assessed at each visit, with a 12-month follow-up. An intention-to-treat analysis was applied.
AB  - RESULTS: Knowledge of hypertension increased by 27.8% in the IG and by 18.5% in the CG, while that of medication increased by 10.1% in the IG and 5.5% in the CG. Treatment adherence measured by the Morisky-Green test increased by 9.6% (95% CI: 5.5-13.6) in the IG and 8.8% (95% CI: 4.9-12.6) in the CG. There were no differences in adherence on the other tests used. No differences were observed between the IG and CG in clinical variables such as blood pressure or BMI at the end of the trial.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The educational intervention had no significant impact on patients' adherence to the medication.Copyright © 2010 SESPAS. Published by Elsevier Espana. All rights reserved.

TI  - Pharmacist intervention program to enhance hypertension control: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Studies have demonstrated that hypertension remains inadequately managed throughout the world, with lack of adherence to BP-lowering medication being a major factor. The aim of the present study was to evaluate if a pharmaceutical care program could improve antihypertensive medication adherence and blood pressure control.
AB  - SETTING: This study was conducted in a secondary care hypertension/dyslipidemia outpatient clinic in the university teaching hospital of Cova da Beira Hospital Centre, Covilha, located in the Eastern Central Region of Portugal.
AB  - METHOD: This report evaluates the pharmacist's interventions during a prospective randomised controlled trial, from July 2009 to June 2010. Patients with diagnosis of essential hypertension attending the clinic for routine follow-up were randomly allocated either to a control group (no pharmaceutical care) or to an intervention group (quarterly follow-up by a hospital pharmacist during a 9-month period). The pharmacist interventions, aimed to increase medication adherence and blood pressure control, involved educational interventions and counselling tips directed to the patient.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and blood pressure control (according to JNC 7 guidelines) assessed at the baseline visit and at the end of pharmaceutical care were the main outcome measures. Blood pressure measurements were performed by blinded nurses. Medication adherence was also evaluated, using a validated questionnaire at baseline and at the end of investigation. Results A total of 197 hypertensive patients were randomly assigned to the study (99 in the control group and 98 in the intervention group). Although there were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in both groups concerning mean age, gender, body mass index, and antihypertensive pharmacotherapy, blood pressure control was higher in the intervention group (P = 0.005) at the end of the study. Significant lower systolic blood pressure (-6.8 mmHg, P = 0.006) and diastolic blood pressure (-2.9 mmHg, P = 0.020) levels were observed in the intervention group. Medication adherence was also significantly higher in the intervention group at the end of the study (74.5% vs. 57.6%, P = 0.012).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Pharmacist intervention can significantly improve medication adherence and blood pressure control in patients treated with antihypertensive agents.

TI  - The effect of patient education and home monitoring on medication compliance, hypertension management, healthy lifestyle behaviours and BMI in a primary health care setting.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of anti-hypertensive patient-oriented education and in-home monitoring for medication adherence and management of hypertension in a primary care setting, by providing education on healthy lifestyle behaviours and medication adherence.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is the third most common cause of death worldwide. Prevalence of hypertension in Turkey is approximately 30% in the general population and 45-50% in population over 50.
AB  - DESIGN: Randomised controlled study.
AB  - METHODS: This study conducted in Turkey used a study group comprised of 120 subjects (40 Group A, 40 Group B, 40 controls), all previously diagnosed with hypertension and who started medication therapy at least one year prior to start of study. The study was conducted between February-November 2006 at public primary health care facilities and homes of the study participants. Participants in Group A and B received a total of six monthly education sessions, four times during clinic visits and two home visits. Medication adherence education for Groups A and B and education about healthy lifestyle behaviours for Group B were administered in a structured and individualised format. The control group was routinely monitored in health care facilities.
AB  - RESULTS: Healthy lifestyle behaviours and perception of self-efficacy regarding medication adherence showed improvement after education sessions in Groups A and B. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures of subjects in Group A and B showed a significant decrease compared with those of the control group; the blood pressure decrease in Group B was greater than in Group A.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Nurses play an important role in uncontrolled hypertension detection and can improve medication adherence and healthy lifestyle behaviours.
AB  - RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Patient education medication adherence alone and in combination with healthy lifestyle behaviour teaching is an effective tool for blood pressure reduction in the hypertensive population in primary health care settings.Copyright © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Reducing cardiovascular disease risk in medically underserved urban and rural communities.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate methods for lowering cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in asymptomatic urban and rural underserved subjects.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medically underserved populations are at increased CVD risk, and systems to lower CVD risk are needed. Nurse management (NM) and telemedicine (T) systems may provide low-cost solutions for this care.
AB  - METHODS: We randomized 465 subjects without overt CVD, with Framingham CVD risk >10% to NM with 4 visits over 1 year, or NM plus T to facilitate weight, blood pressure (BP), and physical activity reporting. The study goal was to reduce CVD risk by 5%.
AB  - RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-eight subjects completed the study. Cardiovascular disease risk fell by > 5% in 32% of the NM group and 26% of the T group (P, nonsignificant). In hyperlipidemic subjects, total cholesterol decreased (NM -21.9 +/- 39.4, T -22.7 +/- 41.3 mg/dL) significantly. In subjects with grade II hypertension (systolic BP > 160 mm Hg, 24% of subjects), both NM and T groups had a similar BP response (average study BP: NM 147.4 +/- 17.5, T 145.3. +/- 18.4, P is nonsignificant), and for those with grade I hypertension (37% of subjects), T had a lower average study BP compared to NM (NM 140.4 +/- 16.9, T 134.6 +/- 15.0, P = .058). In subjects at high risk (Framingham score > 20%), risk fell 6.0% +/- 9.9%; in subjects at intermediate risk (Framingham score > 10, < 20), risk fell 1.3% +/- 4.5% (P < .001 compared to high-risk subjects). Medication adherence was similar in both high- and intermediate-risk subjects.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In 2 underserved populations, CVD risk was reduced by a nurse intervention; T did not add to the risk improvement. Reductions in BP and blood lipids occurred in both high- and intermediate-risk subjects with greatest reductions noted in the high-risk subjects. Frequent communication using a nurse intervention contributes to improved CVD risk in asymptomatic, underserved subjects with increased CVD risk. Telemedicine did not change the effectiveness of the nurse intervention.Copyright © 2011 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effect of feedback in promoting adherence to an exercise programme: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether providing participants in an exercise programme with regular feedback on their exercise progress affected their adherence to the programme regimen.
AB  - METHOD: We conducted a randomized controlled trial. Adult men and women with borderline hypertension and a body mass index > 25.0 were randomized to two intervention groups (groups A and B) and one control group (group C) and were prescribed regular aerobic exercise. During the 12-week study period, group A was provided with both feedback information on their exercise progress and a health letter, while group B was provided with the health letter only. The main outcome measure was exercise performance, per cent achievement of target exercise level (%) defined as the number of weeks during which the exercise target was reached divided by the number of weeks in the programme. Results were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 105 study subjects were randomized into three groups (A, n = 37; B, n = 37 and C, n = 31). Per cent achievement of target exercise level during the 12-week period was highest in group A (26.5%), followed by groups B (22.9%) and C (17.4%) (P = 0.36). Subjects who received regular feedback during the exercise programme tended to have higher exercise performance.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In improving adherence to exercise intervention, the provision of regular feedback to participants in an exercise programme may be an effective intervention.Copyright © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Impact of prolonged antihypertensive duration of action on predicted clinical outcomes in imperfectly adherent patients: comparison of aliskiren, irbesartan and ramipril.[Erratum appears in Int J Clin Pract. 2011 Jul;65(7):820]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most patients miss occasional doses of antihypertensives. The use of 'forgiving' drugs (i.e. drugs with duration of action longer than the 24-h dosing interval) may allow an adequate blood pressure (BP) reduction to be maintained despite missed doses.
AB  - AIM: To quantify the effects of adherence level and duration of action on estimated mean systolic BP (SBP) reduction and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.
AB  - METHOD: For 1250 patients, we simulated 256-day dosing histories with realistically distributed drug holidays based on a study of electronically monitored dosing records. Adherence was set to the desired level by altering the proportion of doses missed. Mean office SBP-lowering effect (aliskiren 300 mg, -14.1 mmHg; irbesartan 300 mg, -13.3; ramipril 10 mg, -10.1 mmHg) and the rate of SBP increase after stopping treatment (off-rate; aliskiren, 1.0 mmHg/day; irbesartan, 3.6 mmHg/day; ramipril, 4.0 mmHg/day) were taken from the results of a randomised, double-blind trial. SBP was averaged over time and patient to estimate mean reductions in SBP and 10-year CVD risk (Framingham risk equation, baseline absolute 10-year CVD risk: 27%).
AB  - RESULTS: Predicted reductions in SBP and CVD risk with aliskiren were larger and less affected by imperfect adherence than the reductions with irbesartan or ramipril. For aliskiren, reducing adherence from 90% to 60% led to a predicted rise in SBP of 1.0 mmHg and three additional CVD events per 1000 treated patients; larger predicted differences were observed for irbesartan (2.5 mmHg; 7.5 events/1000 treated patients) and ramipril (2.2 mmHg; 6.7 events/1000 treated patients).
AB  - CONCLUSION: To offset the effects of imperfect adherence, a common challenge with antihypertensives, for better BP management it may be prudent to prescribe 'forgiving' drugs.Copyright © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - The effect of post-discharge educational intervention on patients in achieving objectives in modifiable risk factors six months after discharge following an episode of acute coronary syndrome, (CAM-2 Project): a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether an intervention mainly consisting of a signed agreement between patient and physician on the objectives to be reached, improves reaching these secondary prevention objectives in modifiable cardiovascular risk factors six-months after discharge following an acute coronary syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is room to improve mid-term adherence to clinical guidelines' recommendations in coronary heart disease secondary prevention, specially non-pharmacological ones, often neglected.
AB  - METHODS: In CAM-2, patients discharged after an acute coronary syndrome were randomly assigned to the intervention or the usual care group. The primary outcome was reaching therapeutic objectives in various secondary prevention variables: smoking, obesity, blood lipids, blood pressure control, exercise and taking of medication.
AB  - RESULTS: 1757 patients were recruited in 64 hospitals and 1510 (762 in the intervention and 748 in the control group) attended the six-months follow-up visit. After adjustment for potentially important variables, there were, between the intervention and control group, differences in the mean reduction of body mass index (0.5 vs. 0.2; p < 0.001) and waist circumference (1.6 cm vs. 0.6 cm; p = 0.05), proportion of patients who exercise regularly and those with total cholesterol below 175 mg/dl (64.7% vs. 56.5%; p = 0.001). The reported intake of medications was high in both groups for all the drugs considered with no differences except for statins (98.1% vs. 95.9%; p = 0.029).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: At least in the short term, lifestyle changes among coronary heart disease patients are achievable by intensifying the responsibility of the patient himself by means of a simple and feasible intervention.

TI  - High adherence and concordance within a clinical trial of antihypertensives.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore hypertensive patients' beliefs about their condition and its treatment and their adherence within the context of a clinical trial. To assess the degree of concordance between patients' beliefs about hypertension and the medical model of the condition.
AB  - METHODS: This was a questionnaire-based study, involving 230 patients participating in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), a randomized controlled trial comparing two pharmaceutical approaches to the management of hypertension. A comparison group of 106 hypertensive patients who were screened for ASCOT but did not meet the entry criteria was also recruited. Outcome measures were beliefs about hypertension and antihypertensive medication, and adherence to medication (self-report and tablet count).
AB  - RESULTS: Adherence to medication was higher than anticipated, with 45% participants reporting complete adherence over the 18-month study and a further 40% only rare non-adherence. Patients' beliefs about their condition and treatment were generally concordant with the medical model of hypertension. High concordance was associated with high medication adherence (p<0.001).
AB  - DISCUSSION: Clinical trial volunteers may have beliefs that are unusually concordant with the medical model of hypertension and may demonstrate atypically high adherence. This has implications for the transferability of trial findings to the general hypertensive population.

TI  - How to avoid discontinuation of antihypertensive treatment: The experience in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the importance of providing guidelines to patients via active telephone calls for blood pressure control and for preventing the discontinuation of treatment among hypertensive patients.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Many reasons exist for non-adherence to medical regimens, and one of the strategies employed to improve treatment compliance is the use of active telephone calls.
AB  - METHODS: Hypertensive patients (n=354) who could receive telephone calls to remind them of their medical appointments and receive instruction about hypertension were distributed into two groups: a) "uncomplicated" - hypertensive patients with no other concurrent diseases and b) "complicated" - severe hypertensive patients (mean diastolic > 110 mmHg with or without medication) or patients with comorbidities. All patients, except those excluded (n=44), were open-block randomized to follow two treatment regimens ("traditional" or "current") and to receive or not receive telephone calls ("phone calls" and "no phone calls" groups, respectively).
AB  - RESULTS: Significantly fewer patients in the "phone calls" group discontinued treatment compared to those in the "no phone calls" group (4 vs. 30; p<0.0094). There was no difference in the percentage of patients with controlled blood pressure in the "phone calls" group and "no phone calls" group or in the "traditional" and "current" groups. The percentage of patients with controlled blood pressure (<140/90 mmHg) was increased at the end of the treatment (74%), reaching 80% in the "uncomplicated" group and 67% in the "complicated" group (p<0.000001).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Guidance to patients via active telephone calls is an efficient strategy for preventing the discontinuation of antihypertensive treatment.

TI  - Study protocol: the Adherence and Intensification of Medications (AIM) study--a cluster randomized controlled effectiveness study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients with diabetes have poor blood pressure (BP) control. Pharmacological therapy is the cornerstone of effective BP treatment, yet there are high rates both of poor medication adherence and failure to intensify medications. Successful medication management requires an effective partnership between providers who initiate and increase doses of effective medications and patients who adhere to the regimen.
AB  - METHODS: In this cluster-randomized controlled effectiveness study, primary care teams within sites were randomized to a program led by a clinical pharmacist trained in motivational interviewing-based behavioral counseling approaches and authorized to make BP medication changes or to usual care. This study involved the collection of data during a 14-month intervention period in three Department of Veterans Affairs facilities and two Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities. The clinical pharmacist was supported by clinical information systems that enabled proactive identification of, and outreach to, eligible patients identified on the basis of poor BP control and either medication refill gaps or lack of recent medication intensification. The primary outcome is the relative change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) measurements over time. Secondary outcomes are changes in Hemoglobin A1c, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), medication adherence determined from pharmacy refill data, and medication intensification rates.
AB  - DISCUSSION: Integration of the three intervention elements--proactive identification, adherence counseling and medication intensification--is essential to achieve optimal levels of control for high-risk patients. Testing the effectiveness of this intervention at the team level allows us to study the program as it would typically be implemented within a clinic setting, including how it integrates with other elements of care.

TI  - Rationale and design of a randomized trial to evaluate an evidence-based prescription drug label on actual medication use.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication errors are an important public health concern, and poor understanding of medication labels are a root cause. Research shows that labels are variable, of poor quality, and not patient-centered. No real-world trials have evaluated whether improved medication labels can affect appropriate medication use, adherence or health outcomes.
AB  - TRIAL DESIGN: We developed an evidence-based prescription label that addresses both content and format. The enhanced label includes a universal medication schedule (UMS) that standardizes the directions for use incorporating 1) standard time periods for administration (morning, noon, evening, and bedtime), 2) numeric vs. alpha characters, 3) 'carriage returns' to separate daily dose and 4) a graphic aid to visually depict dose and frequency. We will evaluate the effect of providing this label to randomly sampled patients who receive their care from free clinics, mobile vans and federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) in Northern Virginia. We will recruit patients with diabetes or hypertension; these patients will be randomly assigned to receive all of their medications with improved labels or to receive prescriptions with standard labels. The primary outcome will be the patient's ability to correctly demonstrate dosing instructions. Other outcomes include adherence, error rates and health outcomes.
AB  - CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this trial is the first to evaluate the effect of prescription label improvement on understanding, medication use and outcomes in a clinical setting. If successful, these findings could be implemented broadly to promote safe and appropriate medication use and to support evidence-based standards in the development of labels.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Efficacy of a brief multifactorial adherence-based intervention on reducing the blood pressure of patients with poor adherence: protocol for a randomized clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lowering of blood pressure by antihypertensive drugs reduces the risks of cardiovascular events, stroke, and total mortality. However, poor adherence to antihypertensive medications reduces their effectiveness and increases the risk of adverse events. In terms of relative risk reduction, an improvement in medication adherence could be as effective as the development of a new drug.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: The proposed randomized controlled trial will include patients with a low adherence to medication and uncontrolled blood pressure. The intervention group will receive a multifactorial intervention during the first, third, and ninth months, to improve adherence. This intervention will include motivational interviews, pill reminders, family support, blood pressure self-recording, and simplification of the dosing regimen.
AB  - MEASUREMENT: The primary outcome is systolic blood pressure. The secondary outcomes are diastolic blood pressure, proportion of patients with adequately controlled blood pressure, and total cost.
AB  - DISCUSSION: The trial will evaluate the impact of a multifactorial adherence intervention in routine clinical practice. Ethical approval was given by the Ethical Committee on Human Research of Balearic islands, Spain (approval number IB 969/08 PI).

TI  - Randomized pilot study of a behavioral feedback intervention to improve medication adherence in older adults with hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Older adults' adherence to antihypertensive medications is far lower than what is considered necessary for clinical effectiveness, despite the risks for adverse cardiovascular events from uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) in the elderly. This pilot study tested a novel 8-week behavioral feedback intervention to improve antihypertensive medication adherence (MA) and BP control among older adults on existing treatment for hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: Adults 60 years old, or older taking at least 1 antihypertensive medication were randomized to receive the nurse-delivered adherence intervention or usual care. Medication adherence was monitored continuously using electronic monitoring for 20 weeks. Intervention-group participants received biweekly MA and BP feedback, habit counseling, medication and disease education, a medication instruction card, and were given an electronic medication bottle cap with a digital display that provided daily adherence feedback during the 8-week intervention. Blood pressure was measured by a nurse at 12 and 20 weeks after randomization. Adherence and BP outcomes were described using descriptive statistics and analyzed for between- and within-group differences using Mann-Whitney U tests.
AB  - RESULTS: Fifteen participants (median age, 71 years; 73% female) were eligible for randomization. Participants took an average of 5.8 prescription medications and 2.93 over-the-counter medications per day. A nonsignificant difference was noted in baseline MA between groups. At the end of the intervention, the treatment group had better antihypertensive MA than did the control group (median MA: 100% vs 27.3%, U = 5.00, P = .013). Systolic BP improved slightly in the intervention group during the study and was significantly different at week 12 (median systolic BP: 130 vs 152 mm Hg; U = 4.50, P = .008). Diastolic BP was largely unchanged over the course of the study.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the intervention had a positive effect on MA. Additional testing is needed to further evaluate the intervention and its effect on adherence behavior and BP control.

TI  - Multicenter cluster-randomized trial of a multifactorial intervention to improve antihypertensive medication adherence and blood pressure control among patients at high cardiovascular risk (the COM99 study).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication nonadherence is common and results in preventable disease complications. This study assessed the effectiveness of a multifactorial intervention to improve both medication adherence and blood pressure control and to reduce cardiovascular events.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: In this multicenter, cluster-randomized trial, physicians from hospital-based hypertension clinics and primary care centers across Spain were randomized to receive and provide the intervention to their high-risk patients. Eligible patients were > 50 years of age, had uncontrolled hypertension, and had an estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk greater than 30%. Physicians randomized to the intervention group counted patients' pills, designated a family member to support adherence behavior, and provided educational information to patients. The primary outcome was blood pressure control at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included both medication adherence and a composite end point of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations. Seventy-nine physicians and 877 patients participated in the trial. The mean duration of follow-up was 39 months. Intervention patients were less likely to have an uncontrolled systolic blood pressure (odds ratio 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.50 to 0.78) and were more likely to be adherent (odds ratio 1.91, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 3.05) than control group patients at 6 months. After 5 years, 16% of the patients in the intervention group and 19% in the control group met the composite end point (hazard ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 1.39).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A multifactorial intervention to improve adherence to antihypertensive medication was effective in improving both adherence and blood pressure control, but it did not appear to improve long-term cardiovascular events.

TI  - Monitoring adherence to medication by measuring change in blood pressure.
AB  - After starting antihypertensives, blood pressure is monitored for several reasons, including assessment of adherence. We aimed to estimate the accuracy of blood pressure monitoring for detecting early nonadherence. We conducted a secondary analysis of the Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS), a large randomized trial of blood pressure lowering to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke. We compared change in blood pressure 3 months after randomization in people who had discontinued treatment (nonadherent) with those who stayed on treatment (adherent). We also used an indirect method, assessing whether change in blood pressure discriminated between active (adherent) and placebo (nonadherent) groups. Both methods gave similar results. For the 3433 subjects, the mean (SD) of the change in systolic blood pressure was -15.8 mm Hg (SD 18.7 mm Hg) in the adherent group and -4.2 mm Hg (SD 18.1 mm Hg) in the nonadherent group. After recalibration of the mean change in the nonadherent group to 0 mm Hg and in the adherent group to -11.6 mm Hg, the absence of a fall in systolic blood pressure at 3 months had a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 80% for detecting nonadherence (50% of nonadherent patients and 20% of adherent patients had a rise in blood pressure). Discriminatory power was modest over the range of cutoffs (area under the receiver-operator curve 0.67). Monitoring blood pressure is poor at detecting nonadherence to blood pressure-lowering treatment. Further research should look at other methods of assessing adherence.

TI  - Effects of 8 weeks sustained follow-up after a nurse consultation on hypertension: a randomised trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of hypertension is high, but the overall control rate is low. Poor control of, hypertension is associated with a number of diseases, such as stroke, heart and renal failure, and high, mortality rates. Studies have shown the separate effects of nurse clinics and telephone follow-up on, blood pressure control, but the incremental effect of combining the two interventions is unknown.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examines whether there is an incremental effect on blood pressure control when using a nurse clinic combined with telephone follow-up.
AB  - METHODS: This was a randomised controlled trial. The primary outcome measure was blood pressure reading. The secondary outcome measures included adherence to home blood pressure monitoring, exercise, diet, medication, and satisfaction with care.
AB  - RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the baseline measures between the control and study groups. Significant differences were found at 8 weeks after intervention was initiated between groups in, systolic blood pressure (control -7.97 vs study -19.03, t=2.35, p=0.022, CI 1.66-20.47) and diastolic, blood pressure (control -3.72 vs study -11.68, t=3.02, p=0.004, CI 2.68-13.24). Other variables with a significant between-group differences (p<0.05) were blood pressure control rate, adherence, to home blood pressure monitoring, exercise and satisfaction with care. Further analysis using, regression showed that home blood pressure monitoring is the most significant predictor for improved, systolic blood pressure.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that nurse clinics have positive effects on blood pressure control and adherence to healthy lifestyle, but telephone follow-up after such clinics augments the effects of the clinic consultation. This combined mode of services is worth considering for other chronic disease, management programmes.Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Implementation of adherence support for patients with hypertension despite antihypertensive therapy in general practice: a cluster randomized trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Uncontrolled hypertension despite treatment is highly prevalent among hypertension patients. Electronic monitoring of medication adherence has been proven to be effective in improving blood pressure. The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of intensive support for implementation of this tool in community pharmacies with minimal implementation support.
AB  - METHODS: In a cluster randomized trial, 25 control pharmacies received a manual and 32 experimental pharmacies received intensive support to enhance implementation of electronic monitoring.
AB  - PRIMARY OUTCOME: the number of patients included for electronic monitoring. Secondary outcomes included mean change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and percentage of patients with adequate SBP control.
AB  - RESULTS: The experimental group yielded consistently higher scores on all the steps of the implementation process than the control group, but none of these differences were significant. The mean number of patients per pharmacy included for electronic monitoring in a 3-9-months period was 1.6 in the experimental group vs. 1.0 in the control group (difference = 0.7, 95% confidence interval = -0.4; 1.7). The following patient outcomes were pooled because there were no differences between the experimental and the control group. Mean change of SBP/diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was -12 and -6 mm Hg, respectively, SBP dropped <140 mm Hg in 20.9% of all patients. In 13.6% of all patients control of SBP was achieved without treatment intensification.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The intensive implementation program enhanced pharmacist performance, but appeared insufficient to overcome all problems with the implementation of electronic monitoring. The major restrictive factors concerned general practitioner (GP) involvement and the identification of eligible patients.

TI  - Does telephone follow-up improve blood pressure after minor stroke or TIA?.
AB  - BACKGROUND: hypertension is a common risk factor for stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and there is good evidence that blood pressure (BP) control prevents recurrent stroke. We investigated whether telephone follow-up (TFU) improved risk factor management in hypertensive patients after stroke/TIA.
AB  - METHODS: we conducted a randomised controlled trial and assigned hypertensive patients within 1 month of stroke or TIA to receive usual care (n = 27) or usual care plus regular TFU (n = 29). Primary outcome was the difference in 12 h ambulatory systolic BP change from baseline to 6 months (DeltaSBP) in both groups. TFU at 7 days, 1, 2 and 4 months included patient-focussed education and goal setting.
AB  - RESULTS: mean baseline BP was 145/83 mm Hg (standard deviation (SD) 21/14). There was no significant difference in DeltaSBP over 6 months with TFU. Median DeltaSBP was 0 mm Hg (interquartile range 19.5) in the TFU group and 3.0 mm Hg (20) fall in the usual care group (P = 0.29). Post hoc analysis showed that statin use increased from baseline to 6 months (P = 0.02) and cholesterol was significantly lower at 6 months in all patients (mean reduction 0.95 mmol/l; P < 0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSION: our study found TFU that promoted patient-led management of risk factors did not improve BP control over 6-month follow-up in primary care after stroke/TIA.

TI  - The economic consequences of non-adherence to lipid-lowering therapy: results from the Anglo-Scandinavian-Cardiac Outcomes Trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adherence to lipid-lowering therapy in clinical practice is less than ideal. Analysis of registry data has indicated that this is associated with poor outcomes. The objective of the present analysis was to assess the impact of high adherence to drug (defined as > 80% of days covered), compared with low adherence to drug (< 50% of days covered) in terms of risk of events and long-term economic consequences.
AB  - DESIGN: Open-label follow up of a randomised placebo-controlled trial in hypertensive patients.
AB  - METHODS: Cox proportional hazards and Poisson regression models were used to assess the hazard ratio of patients with high adherence compared with low adherence while controlling for cardiovascular risk. A Markov model was used to predict the long-term costs and health outcomes associated with poor adherence during the follow-up period.
AB  - RESULTS: Both statistical models indicated that high adherence is associated with improved prognosis [Cox model: 0.75; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.56-0.98, Poisson model hazard ratio: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.58-0.98]. Discounted at 3.5% per year, the Markov model predicts that as a consequence of higher adherence during the follow-up period, costs would be higher (1689 pounds per patient compared with 1323 pounds per patient) because of higher drug costs, but the projected survival and quality-adjusted survival (QALY) would also be longer (10.83 compared with 10.81 life years and 8.13 compared with 8.11 QALYs).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Given the higher risk of cardiovascular events associated with low adherence shown here, measures to improve adherence are an important part of the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Improvement of hypertension management by structured physician education and feedback system: cluster randomized trial.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: We aimed to assess whether hypertension management with a structured physician information program and a feedback system leads to improved blood pressure (BP) control and cardiovascular outcomes.
AB  - METHODS: Cluster randomized (3 : 1), open, monitored, multicenter trial in Germany. Primary care-based physicians in the information group (IG) received detailed training on hypertension guidelines, feedback on target-level attainment, and a reminder to intensify treatment after each patient visit, whereas the observation/control group (CG) did not receive any such measures. A three-level mixed model was developed. Time-independent level differences between groups, group-independent changes, and nonparallel group-specific changes over time were tested.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 15 041 (78.1%) hypertensive patients were in the IG and 4213 (21.9%) in the CG. By 1-year follow-up, 82.9% of patients in the IG and 81.5% in the CG remained in the study. The guideline-oriented BP target was attained by 56.8% in the IG and 52.5% in the CG (+4.3%, P = 0.03), whereas the individual BP target was attained by 57.0% in the IG and 51% in the CG (P = NS). BP control in the IG was achieved 2 months earlier on average. Clinical inertia, defined as the absence of medication changes, despite noncontrol of BP, occurred significantly less often in the IG group. One-year cardiovascular outcomes did not differ between groups.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The delivery of systematic information in connection with a feedback system reduces clinical inertia and improves guideline adherence. Although compared with earlier studies, the hypertension control rates obtained are higher, there is still considerable room for improvement.

TI  - Safety and tolerability of an olmesartan medoxomil-based regimen in patients with stage 1 hypertension: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the reasons for suboptimal blood pressure (BP) control in patients with hypertension is poor adherence to treatment, which may be caused by treatment-emergent adverse events. Therefore, it is crucial for an antihypertensive agent to provide a high level of efficacy without compromising tolerability.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a titrate-to-goal, olmesartan medoxomil-based therapy in patients with stage 1 hypertension (seated systolic BP [SeSBP] of 140-159 mmHg or seated diastolic BP [SeDBP] of 90-99 mmHg).
AB  - METHODS: This was a pre-specified analysis of data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre (29 sites) clinical study conducted from January to October 2007 in the US. Male and female patients (n = 130) aged >or=18 years with stage 1 hypertension were included in the analysis. Patients were treated with either placebo or an olmesartan medoxomil-based titration regimen, which comprised treatment with olmesartan medoxomil plus hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) as required to achieve a target BP of <120/80 mmHg. The current analysis focused on the safety of olmesartan medoxomil in patients with stage 1 hypertension, particularly in terms of discontinuation rates and the incidence of dizziness and orthostatic hypotension. Safety and tolerability were assessed throughout the study. The primary efficacy outcome was the least-squares (LS) mean change from baseline in SeSBP after 12 weeks' double-blind treatment. Additional efficacy variables included LS mean change from baseline in SeDBP at 12 weeks and the proportions of patients achieving BP goals at study end and at each titration step.
AB  - RESULTS: In patients with stage 1 hypertension, the olmesartan medoxomil-based regimen was generally well tolerated at all titration steps, and discontinuation due to adverse events was similar between olmesartan medoxomil and placebo. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 16.1% up to 27.6% of olmesartan medoxomil recipients and between 8.3% and 24.3% of placebo recipients, across treatment regimens; a slight increase in the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was observed with olmesartan medoxomil/HCTZ versus olmesartan medoxomil alone (<or=27.6% vs <or=19.3%). In addition, one or more drug-related events were reported in up to 10.3% of olmesartan medoxomil recipients and up to 5.7% of placebo recipients. Gastrointestinal disorders (<or=10.0%), nervous system disorders (<or=10.3%), and infections/infestations (<or=7.1%) were the most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events in the olmesartan medoxomil treatment group. The most common nervous system disorders in the olmesartan medoxomil treatment group were dizziness (<or=6.9%) and headache (<or=5.4%). Orthostatic hypotension was not reported. The LS mean differences between olmesartan medoxomil and placebo for change from baseline in SeSBP (-22.0 mmHg; 95% confidence interval [CI] -26.9, -17.3) and SeDBP (-12.2 mmHg; 95% CI -14.9, -9.4; both p < 0.0001) significantly favoured olmesartan medoxomil at week 12 with last observation carried forward. At study end, a BP goal of <140/90 mmHg was achieved by 81.0% of patients in the olmesartan medoxomil group versus 43.1% of patients in the placebo group (p < 0.0001).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Olmesartan medoxomil-based therapy was well tolerated in this study among patients with stage 1 hypertension and demonstrated a placebo-like safety and tolerability profile. This regimen was also effective in terms of BP lowering and enabling patients to achieve BP goals without an adverse effect on tolerability.

TI  - Renal function, cardiovascular disease risk factors' prevalence and 5-year disease incidence; the role of diet, exercise, lipids and inflammation markers: the ATTICA study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate the association between renal function and various cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, as well as 5-year incidence of CVD, in a sample of CVD free adults.
AB  - METHODS: (i) Cross-sectional information from n = 1975. Greek men and women (>18 years) without CVD and hypertension at baseline examination and (ii) 5-year (2001-06) survival data from n = 2101 individuals without CVD at baseline, all participants in the ATTICA study, were analysed in this work. Kidney function was quantified by the baseline estimated creatinine clearance rate (C(cr)), using the Cockcroft-Gault formula and the National Kidney Foundation recommendations. Outcome of interest was the development of CVD that was defined according to WHO-ICD-10 criteria.
AB  - RESULTS: At baseline, the prevalence of moderate-to-severe renal dysfunction (i.e. C(cr) < 60) was 2.8% in males and 7.7% in females. Physical activity status, cigarette smoking, hypercholesterolemia and homocysteine levels and greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet were inversely associated with C(cr) rate (P < 0.05), while no association was found with history of diabetes. During the 5-year follow-up, people with moderate-to-severe renal dysfunction as compared with normal, had 3.21 times higher CVD risk [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.98-5.19], after adjusting for history of hypertension (hazard ratio = 2.15, 95% CI 1.48-3.11), hypercholesterolemia (1.37, 0.98-1.98), diabetes (3.28, 2.15-5.00), smoking habits (0.89, 0.60-1.32) and physical activity status (0.86, 0.56-1.21).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Renal function seems to be associated with the levels of lifestyle and bio-clinical CVD risk factors and contribute to the long-term incidence of cardiac events. Public health care practitioners should take into account renal function in better preventing the burden of CVD at individual, and population level, as well.

TI  - Does a colour-coded blood pressure diary improve blood pressure control for patients in general practice: the CoCo trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Insufficient blood pressure control is a frequent problem despite the existence of effective treatment. Insufficient adherence to self-monitoring as well as to therapy is a common reason. Blood pressure self-measurement at home (Home Blood Pressure Measurement, HBPM) has positive effects on treatment adherence and is helpful in achieving the target blood pressure. Only a few studies have investigated whether adherence to HBPM can be improved through simple measures resulting also in better blood pressure control.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Improvement of self-monitoring and improved blood pressure control by using a new colour-coded blood pressure diary.
AB  - OUTCOME:
AB  - PRIMARY OUTCOME: Change in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure 6 months after using the new colour-coded blood pressure diary.Secondary outcome: Adherence to blood pressure self-measurement (number of measurements/entries).
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: Randomised controlled study.
AB  - POPULATION: 138 adult patients in primary care with uncontrolled hypertension despite therapy. The control group uses a conventional blood pressure diary; the intervention group uses the new colour-coded blood pressure diary (green, yellow, red according a traffic light system). EXPECTED RESULTS/CONCLUSION: The visual separation and entries in three colour-coded areas reflecting risk (green: blood pressure in the target range <or= 140/<or= 90 mmHg, yellow: blood pressure >140/>90 mmHg, red: blood pressure in danger zone > 180 mmHg/>110 mmHg) lead to better self-monitoring compared with the conventional (non-colour-coded) blood pressure booklet. The colour-coded, visualised information supports improved perception (awareness and interpretation) of blood pressure and triggers correct behaviour, in the means of improved adherence to the recommended treatment as well as better communication between patients and doctors resulting in improved blood pressure control.

TI  - Effect of self-efficacy and social support on adherence to antihypertensive drugs.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between poor adherence and self-efficacy or social support after a pharmacist intervention.
AB  - DESIGN: Post-hoc analysis of data from two randomized controlled trials of physician-pharmacist collaborative interventions (6 and 9 mo, respectively) to improve blood pressure control.
AB  - SETTING: Eleven university-affiliated primary care clinics.
AB  - PATIENTS: Five hundred eighty-four patients (aged 21-85 yrs) with uncontrolled primary hypertension; 296 were in the intervention group and 288 were in the control group.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Pharmacists provided intensified hypertension management and drug adherence counseling to patients in the intervention group.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Social support and self-efficacy questionnaires were administered at baseline and end-of-study visits. Patient adherence was monitored by using the Morisky self-reported adherence questionnaire. Self-reported adherence scores improved significantly in the control group (p=0.0053) but not in the intervention group; however, adherence at baseline in both groups was high. There were small, but significant, improvements in self-efficacy (p<0.04) and social support (p<0.05) scores in the intervention group but not the control group at the end of the study. Social support and, to a lesser extent, self-efficacy improved as a function of duration of study participation (9-mo vs 6-mo intervention), regardless of whether the patient received the intervention. Blood pressure control in both groups improved significantly at the end of the study; however, mean blood pressure was significantly lower in the intervention group (129.7/76.6 mm Hg) compared with the control group (140.8/78.9 mm Hg; p<0.0001 for systolic, p=0.032 for diastolic).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Social support and self-efficacy improved significantly in the intervention group at the end of the pharmacist intervention. Drug adherence was correlated with self-efficacy even though drug adherence did not improve significantly in the intervention group. The fact that social support and self-efficacy improved as a function of duration of study participation suggests that participation in a research study may have had a positive influence on these measures. Even though the changes in social support, self-efficacy, and drug adherence were modest, there was significantly better blood pressure control in the intervention group compared with the control group. These findings indicate that changes in drug adherence, self-efficacy, or social support probably played a minor role in the blood pressure outcomes in these studies.

TI  - Vitamins C and E to prevent complications of pregnancy-associated hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress has been proposed as a mechanism linking the poor placental perfusion characteristic of preeclampsia with the clinical manifestations of the disorder. We assessed the effects of antioxidant supplementation with vitamins C and E, initiated early in pregnancy, on the risk of serious adverse maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes related to pregnancy-associated hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial involving nulliparous women who were at low risk for preeclampsia. Women were randomly assigned to begin daily supplementation with 1000 mg of vitamin C and 400 IU of vitamin E or matching placebo between the 9th and 16th weeks of pregnancy. The primary outcome was severe pregnancy-associated hypertension alone or severe or mild hypertension with elevated liver-enzyme levels, thrombocytopenia, elevated serum creatinine levels, eclamptic seizure, medically indicated preterm birth, fetal-growth restriction, or perinatal death.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 10,154 women underwent randomization. The two groups were similar with respect to baseline characteristics and adherence to the study drug. Outcome data were available for 9969 women. There was no significant difference between the vitamin and placebo groups in the rates of the primary outcome (6.1% and 5.7%, respectively; relative risk in the vitamin group, 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91 to 1.25) or in the rates of preeclampsia (7.2% and 6.7%, respectively; relative risk, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.24). Rates of adverse perinatal outcomes did not differ significantly between the groups.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin C and E supplementation initiated in the 9th to 16th week of pregnancy in an unselected cohort of low-risk, nulliparous women did not reduce the rate of adverse maternal or perinatal outcomes related to pregnancy-associated hypertension (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00135707).Copyright 2010 Massachusetts Medical Society

TI  - Evaluation of a community pharmacy-based intervention for improving patient adherence to antihypertensives: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The majority of patients using antihypertensive medications fail to achieve their recommended target blood pressure. Poor daily adherence with medication regimens and a lack of persistence with medication use are two of the major reasons for failure to reach target blood pressure. There is no single intervention to improve adherence with antihypertensives that is consistently effective. Community pharmacists are in an ideal position to promote adherence to chronic medications. This study aims to test a specific intervention package that could be integrated into the community pharmacy workflow to enable pharmacists to improve patient adherence and/or persistence with antihypertensive medications--Hypertension Adherence Program in Pharmacy (HAPPY).
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: The HAPPY trial is a multi-centre prospective randomised controlled trial. Fifty-six pharmacies have been recruited from three Australian states. To identify potential patients, a software application (MedeMine CVD) extracted data from a community pharmacy dispensing software system (FRED Dispense). The pharmacies have been randomised to either 'Pharmacist Care Group' (PCG) or 'Usual Care Group' (UCG). To check for 'Hawthorne effect' in the UCG, a third group of patients 'Hidden Control Group' (HCG) will be identified in the UCG pharmacies, which will be made known to the pharmacists at the end of six months. Each study group requires 182 patients. Data will be collected at baseline, three and six months in the PCG and at baseline and six months in the UCG. Changes in patient adherence and persistence at the end of six months will be measured using the self-reported Morisky score, the Tool for Adherence Behaviour Screening and medication refill data.
AB  - DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first research testing a comprehensive package of evidence-based interventions that could be integrated into the community pharmacy workflow to enable pharmacists to improve patient adherence and/or persistence with antihypertensive medications. The unique features of the HAPPY trial include the use of MedeMine CVD to identify patients who could potentially benefit from the service, control for the 'Hawthorne effect' in the UCG and the offer of the intervention package at the end of six months to patients in the UCG, a strategy that is expected to improve retention.

TI  - Deterioration of blood pressure control after discontinuation of a physician-pharmacist collaborative intervention.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess blood pressure control after discontinuation of a physician-pharmacist collaborative intervention.
AB  - DESIGN: Comparative analysis of data of the patients who received the intervention versus a control group from a prospective, cluster-randomized, 9-month efficacy trial and the same patients' data 18 and 27 months after completion of the trial, abstracted from their medical records.
AB  - SETTING: Five primary care medical offices operated by a university health system.
AB  - PATIENTS: One hundred four patients with hypertension; 65 were in the intervention group, and 39 were in the control group.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the prospective study, patients were randomized to receive a physician-pharmacist collaborative intervention to improve blood pressure control or to the control group. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured by a research nurse at baseline and at the end of the study (9 mo later). In the current study, data were abstracted for blood pressure and blood pressure control at 18 and 27 months (9 and 18 mo, respectively, after discontinuation of the study). At baseline, mean +/- SD systolic blood pressure was 152.5 +/- 9.5 and 150.1 +/- 9.6 mm Hg in the intervention and control groups, respectively (p=0.22). At 9 months, systolic blood pressure decreased to 124.5 +/- 10.7 and 132.0 +/- 15.1 mm Hg (p=0.0038 between groups), and blood pressure was controlled in 78.5% and 48.7% (p=0.0017) of patients in the intervention and control groups, respectively. By 18 months, systolic blood pressure had deteriorated to 131.0 +/- 12.2 and 143.3 +/- 17.5 mm Hg (p<0.001), and blood pressure control rates decreased to 53.9% and 30.8% (p=0.02). By 27 months, systolic blood pressure was 131.3 +/- 13.0 and 141.2 +/- 15.8 mm Hg (p=0.0008), and blood pressure control was 55.4% and 35.9% (p=0.05).
AB  - CONCLUSION: A sustained positive effect on blood pressure control was noted up to 18 months after discontinuation of a physician-pharmacist collaborative intervention, when compared with a control group. Blood pressure control did deteriorate at a similar rate in both the intervention and control groups, but the percentage of patients with controlled blood pressure remained significantly higher in the intervention group. These results suggest that continued interventions by pharmacists may be necessary to maintain high rates of blood pressure control, especially in those patients whose blood pressure begins to increase.

TI  - Effect of self-measurement of blood pressure on adherence to treatment in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor adherence to treatment is one of the major problems in the treatment of hypertension. Self blood pressure measurement may help patients to improve their adherence to treatment.
AB  - METHOD: In this prospective, randomized, controlled study coordinated by a university hospital, a total of 228 mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients were randomized to either a group that performed self-measurements at home in addition to office blood pressure measurements [the self-pressure group (n = 114)] or a group that only underwent office blood pressure measurement [the office pressure group (n = 114)]. Patients were followed for 1 year in which treatment was adjusted, if necessary, at each visit to the physician's office according to the achieved blood pressure. Adherence to treatment was assessed by means of medication event monitoring system TrackCaps.
AB  - RESULTS: Median adherence was slightly greater in patients from the self-pressure group than in those from the office pressure group (92.3 vs. 90.9%; P = 0.043). Although identical among both groups, in the week directly after each visit to the physician's office, adherence [71.4% (interquartile range 71-79%)] was significantly lower (P < 0.001) than that at the last 7 days prior to each visit [100% (interquartile range 90-100%)]. On the remaining days between the visits, patients from the self-pressure group displayed a modestly better adherence than patients from the office pressure group (97.6 vs. 97.0%; P = 0.024).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Although self-blood pressure measurement as an adjunct to office blood pressure measurement led to somewhat better adherence to treatment in this study, the difference was only small and not clinically significant. The time relative to a visit to the doctor seems to be a more important predictor of adherence.

TI  - The devil is in the detail - a multifactorial intervention to reduce blood pressure in co-existing diabetes and chronic kidney disease: a single blind, randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: About 30-60% of individuals are non-adherent to their prescribed medications and this risk increases as the number of prescribed medications increases. This paper outlines the development of a consumer-centred Medicine Self-Management Intervention (MESMI), designed to improve blood pressure control and medication adherence in consumers with diabetes and chronic kidney disease recruited from specialist outpatients' clinics.
AB  - METHODS: We developed a multifactorial intervention consisting of Self Blood Pressure Monitoring (SBPM), medication review, a twenty-minute interactive Digital Versatile Disc (DVD), and follow-up support telephone calls to help consumers improve their blood pressure control and take their medications as prescribed. The intervention is novel in that it has been developed from analysis of consumer and health professional views, and includes consumer video exemplars in the DVD. The primary outcome measure was a drop of 3-6 mmHg systolic blood pressure at three months after completion of the intervention. Secondary outcome measures included: assessment of medication adherence, medication self-efficacy and general wellbeing. Consumers' adherence to their prescribed medications was measured by manual pill count, self-report of medication adherence, and surrogate biochemical markers of disease control.
AB  - DISCUSSION: The management of complex health problems is an increasing component of health care practice, and requires interventions that improve patient outcomes. We describe the preparatory work and baseline data of a single blind, randomized controlled trial involving consumers requiring cross-specialty care with a follow-up period extending to 12 months post-baseline.
AB  - TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register (ACTRN12607000044426).

TI  - Impact of adopting low sodium diet on biomarkers of inflammation and coagulation: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A low sodium diet is an established intervention in the treatment of impaired renal function and hypertension which may modulate cardiovascular risk independent of recognised antihypertensive effects. Epidemiological data suggest that dietary sodium intake may be associated with systemic inflammation: another potential pathophysiological mechanism by which sodium intake may modify vascular disease.
AB  - METHODS: We tested the hypothesis that adopting a low sodium diet may decrease biomarkers of systemic inflammation or coagulation using data from a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Participants (n=171; aged 18-65 years) in a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial of a low sodium diet for 6 weeks provided paired serum samples for analysis to assess the impact of adopting a low sodium diet on biomarkers of systemic inflammation and coagulation.
AB  - RESULTS: There was a significant difference in 24-hour sodium urinary excretion between the low sodium intake and the normal sodium intake groups of 43 mmol (p<0.001). In the primary analysis there was no effect of adopting a low sodium diet on serum D-dimers, but high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was reduced by 1.13 mg/L (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.03 to 2.22). However, after elimination of outlying high values for baseline serum hsCRP (>10 mg/L), this effect was attenuated (-0.47 mg/L; 95% CI, -1.25 to 0.31).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Using data from a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial in asthma with objective confirmation of adherence to the low sodium diet, we report that adopting a low sodium diet for 6 weeks has no effect on measures of systemic inflammation or coagulation.

TI  - Assessing medication adherence simultaneously by electronic monitoring and pill count in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor adherence to antihypertensive medication is one of the major problems in the treatment of hypertension. Electronic monitoring is currently considered to be the gold standard for assessing adherence, but it may trigger patients to open the pill bottle without taking medication or to take out more than prescribed. In adjunct to electronic monitoring, pill count could be a valuable tool for exploring adherence patterns, and their effects on blood pressure reduction.
AB  - METHODS: Among a total of 228 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, adherence to treatment was measured by means of both the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) and pill count. Patients were followed-up for seven visits over a period of 1 year. At each visit to the physician's office, patient's adherence was assessed by both methods.
AB  - RESULTS: Adherence is defined as the percentage of days with correct dosing; median adherence according to MEMS was lower than median adherence according to pill count (91.6 vs. 96.1; P < 0.001). Both methods agreed in defining patients as adherent in 107 (47%) and nonadherent in 33 (14%) patients. Thirty-one (14%) patients were adherent only by MEMS and 59 (25%) patients only by pill count. At the end of the study, patients in the four categories reached comparable blood pressure values and reductions.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Pill count could be a useful adjunct to electronic monitoring in assessing adherence patterns. Although deviant intake behavior occurred frequently, the effect on achieved blood pressure and blood pressure reduction was not remarkable.

TI  - Effectiveness of a protocol-based strategy for achieving better blood pressure control in general practice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There continues be a problem with the proportion of treated hypertension patients who are actually at recommended blood pressure targets.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Is an intensive protocol-based strategy for achieving blood pressure control effective in family practice and will family physicians and their hypertensive patients adhere to such a protocol.
AB  - METHODS: Design of the study is a cluster randomized controlled trial at the Centre for Studies in Primary Care, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario. Participants were 19 family physicians and 156 (98 intervention group and 58 control group) of their patients in and around the Kingston area. Patients were eligible if they had a diagnosis of hypertension and had not yet achieved their target blood pressure. Patients in the intervention group were managed according to a protocol that involved seeing their family doctor every 2 weeks over a 16-week period and having their antihypertensive medication regimen adjusted at each visit if target was not achieved. This was compared to usual care. Main outcomes were primary effectiveness outcome measured at 12 months was the differences in blood pressure between baseline and 12 months in the two groups. Secondary effectiveness outcomes included rates of achieving BP target and compliance with protocol by physicians and patients. Adherence outcomes were assessed by determining the number of visits made during the 16-week intervention period and the increase in the number of drugs being used.
AB  - RESULTS: Of the patients enrolled, 72 (74%) from the intervention group and 41 (71%) in the control group were available for analysis. Improvement between baseline and 12-month follow-up was significantly better for the intervention group than the control for diastolic mean daytime BP on 24 hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (4.5 mmHg reduction versus 0.5 mmHg reduction) and for both systolic (14.7 mmHg reduction versus 2.7 mmHg reduction) and diastolic (7.4 mmHg reduction versus 0.6 mmHg increase) blood pressure on BpTRU. Of the 98 patients in the intervention, 80% attended four or more of the eight visits and 25% attended all eight visits; physicians increased the number or dosage of drugs the patient was taking in 52% of the visits. Conclusions. An intensive, protocol-based, management approach to achieving blood pressure control in hypertensive patients in family practice is effective and works even when there is flexibility built into the algorithm to allow family physicians to use their judgement in individual patients.

TI  - Maintenance of blood-pressure-lowering effect following a missed dose of aliskiren, irbesartan or ramipril: results of a randomized, double-blind study.
AB  - Most patients inadvertently miss an occasional dose of antihypertensive therapy, and hence drugs that provide sustained blood-pressure (BP) reduction beyond the 24-h dosing interval are desirable. The primary objective of this study was to compare the 24-h mean ambulatory BP reductions from baseline after a simulated missed dose of the direct renin inhibitor aliskiren, irbesartan or ramipril. In this double-blind study, 654 hypertensive patients (24-h mean ambulatory diastolic BP (MADBP) >or=85 mm Hg) were randomized 1:1:1 to once-daily aliskiren 150 mg, irbesartan 150 mg or ramipril 5 mg. Doses were doubled after 2 weeks. At day 42, patients were again randomized equally within each group to receive 1 day of placebo ('missed dose') on either day 42 or day 49. Patients with a successful 24-h ambulatory BP measurement at baseline and on day 42/49 were included in the analyses. The 24-h mean ambulatory systolic BP (MASBP)/MADBP reductions from baseline after a missed dose of aliskiren 300 mg (9.3/7.0 mm Hg) were similar to irbesartan 300 mg (9.5/7.3 mm Hg) and significantly larger than ramipril 10 mg (7.1/5.0 mm Hg, P<or=0.008). Loss of BP-lowering effect with aliskiren in the 24 h after a missed dose (1.0/0.7 mm Hg for 24-48-h vs 0-24-h MASBP/MADBP) was significantly lower than with irbesartan (3.6/2.2 mm Hg, P<0.01) or ramipril (4.0/2.6, P<0.0001). This equates to maintenance of 91/91% of the MASBP/MADBP-lowering effect with aliskiren, greater than irbesartan (73/77%) or ramipril (64/65%). The incidence of adverse events was similar across treatments (32.9-36.0%), although ramipril treatment was associated with an increased incidence of cough (ramipril, 6.1%; aliskiren, 0.5%; irbesartan, 1.8%). Aliskiren 300 mg provided a sustained BP-lowering effect beyond the 24-h dosing interval, with a significantly smaller loss of BP-lowering effect in the 24-48 h period after dose than irbesartan 300 mg or ramipril 10 mg.

TI  - The impact of an electronic monitoring and reminder device on patient compliance with antihypertensive therapy: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: High blood pressure (BP) significantly increases overall cardiovascular risk, the incidence of ischemic heart disease and stroke. One of the most important causes of insufficient BP control is low treatment compliance. Reminders and electronic compliance monitoring have been shown to be effective in improving patient compliance to some extent, but the combined effect has not been documented.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of an electronic reminder and monitoring device on patient compliance and BP control.
AB  - METHODS: All patients received medical treatment with telmisartan once daily and were randomized to either electronic compliance monitoring with a reminder and monitoring device or standard therapy for 6 months. Both groups were crossed over after 6 months. Intervention effectiveness was assessed using self-reported compliance and BP.
AB  - RESULTS: Data from 398 patients were analysed. In the first half of the study, patients using the device reported 91% compliance versus 85% in the control group. This difference diminished after crossover (88 versus 86%). BP was not affected. Electronic monitoring data on compliance revealed taking, dosing and timing compliance between 45 and 52% in study group 1, and between 32 and 38% in study group 2.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The Helping Hand reminder device was most suitable if used for newly diagnosed hypertensive patients, when it improved compliance by 6%. With the present medical treatment, the device does not have any influence on BP control, but with less forgiving medications, the device might make a significant difference. The use of the device can be an easy and effective way to improve compliance in selected patients.

TI  - Are co-morbidities associated with guideline adherence? The MI-Plus study of Medicare patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The impact of co-morbid illnesses on adherence to guideline recommendations in chronic illness is of growing concern. We tested a framework [Piette and Kerr, Diabetes Care. 29(3):725-31, 2006] of provider adherence to guidelines in the presence of co-morbid conditions, which suggests that the effect of co-morbid conditions depends on treatment recommendations for the co-morbid conditions and how symptomatic they are.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted an exploratory analysis to assess the framework using chart audit data for 1,240 post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI) Medicare beneficiaries in Alabama. We assessed level of guideline-adherent post-AMI care from chart-based quality indicators and constructed scores reflecting how much care for the co-morbid condition was similar to post-AMI care (concordance) and how symptomatic the co-morbid condition is, based on expert opinion.
AB  - RESULTS: Patients had a mean age of 74 years, mean co-morbidities of 2, and 61% were white. Both concordance and symptomatic scores were positively associated with guideline compliance, with correlations of 0.32 and 0.14, respectively (p < 0.001 for each). We found positive correlations between highly concordant co-morbid conditions and post-AMI quality scores and negative correlations between highly symptomatic conditions and post-AMI quality scores; both findings support the framework. However, the framework performed less well for conditions that were not highly concordant or highly symptomatic, and the magnitudes of the associations were not large.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The framework was related to the association of co-morbid conditions with adherence by providers to guideline-recommended treatment for post-AMI patients. The framework holds promise for evaluating and possibly predicting guideline adherence.

TI  - Predictors of medication adherence for African American patients diagnosed with hypertension.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence, morbidity and mortality of hypertension are strikingly higher for African Americans than for Whites. Poor adherence to the antihypertensive medication regimen is a major cause of inadequate blood pressure control. In this study, we assess the relationship of antihypertensive medication adherence to sociodemographic, clinical and cognitive characteristics of urban African American adults.
AB  - METHOD: Data were drawn from a larger randomized controlled trial assessing the effect of a behavioral intervention to improve medication adherence and blood pressure control among hypertensive African American patients followed in an urban primary care network. Medication adherence was assessed at baseline using the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS)--a method regarded as the gold standard for assessing medication adherence in clinical research. Information on potential correlates of medication adherence (sociodemographic, clinical and cognitive) was obtained at baseline by computer-assisted interview. We assessed the cross sectional association of these factors to medication adherence in baseline data.
AB  - RESULTS: Medication adherence was significantly associated with systolic blood pressure (r=.253, P<.04) and self-reported medication adherence (r=.285, P<.03). The relationship of education to medication adherence varied significantly by sex (P<.05 for interaction). Specifically, lower educational attainment was related to higher adherence among men, but lower adherence among women.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Identifying correlates of low antihypertensive medication adherence and their interactions, as in this study, will help health providers to better recognize patients at higher risk for worse hypertension-related outcomes. This knowledge can also inform interventions which target a higher-risk subset of hypertensive patients.

TI  - The impact of a multidisciplinary information technology-supported program on blood pressure control in primary care.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a leading mortality risk factor yet inadequately controlled in most affected subjects. Effective programs to address this problem are lacking. We hypothesized that an information technology-supported management program could help improve blood pressure (BP) control.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: This randomized controlled trial included 223 primary care hypertensive subjects with mean 24-hour BP >130/80 and daytime BP >135/85 mm Hg measured with ambulatory monitoring (ABPM). Intervention subjects received a BP monitor and access to an information technology-supported adherence and BP monitoring system providing nurses, pharmacists, and physicians with monthly reports. Control subjects received usual care. The mean (+/-SD) follow-up was 348 (+/-78) and 349 (+/-84) days in the intervention and control group, respectively. The primary end point of the change in the mean 24-hour ambulatory BP was consistently greater in intervention subjects for both systolic (-11.9 versus -7.1 mm Hg; P<0.001) and diastolic BP (-6.6 versus -4.5 mm Hg; P=0.007). The proportion of subjects that achieved Canadian Guideline target BP (46.0% versus 28.6%) was also greater in the intervention group (P=0.006). We observed similar BP declines for ABPM and self-recorded home BP suggesting the latter could be an alternative for confirming BP control. The intervention was associated with more physician-driven antihypertensive dose adjustments or changes in agents (P=0.03), more antihypertensive classes at study end (P=0.007), and a trend toward improved adherence measured by prescription refills (P=0.07).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This multidisciplinary information technology-supported program that provided feedback to patients and healthcare providers significantly improved blood pressure levels in a primary care setting.

TI  - The effectiveness of health coaching, home blood pressure monitoring, and home-titration in controlling hypertension among low-income patients: protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the many antihypertensive medications available, two-thirds of patients with hypertension do not achieve blood pressure control. This is thought to be due to a combination of poor patient education, poor medication adherence, and "clinical inertia." The present trial evaluates an intervention consisting of health coaching, home blood pressure monitoring, and home medication titration as a method to address these three causes of poor hypertension control.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: The randomized controlled trial will include 300 patients with poorly controlled hypertension. Participants will be recruited from a primary care clinic in a teaching hospital that primarily serves low-income populations.An intervention group of 150 participants will receive health coaching, home blood pressure monitoring, and home-titration of antihypertensive medications during 6 months. The control group (n=150) will receive health coaching plus home blood pressure monitoring for the same duration. A passive control group will receive usual care. Blood pressure measurements will take place at baseline, and after 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome will be change in systolic blood pressure after 6 and 12 months. Secondary outcomes measured will be change in diastolic blood pressure, adverse events, and patient and provider satisfaction.
AB  - DISCUSSION: The present study is designed to assess whether the 3-pronged approach of health coaching, home blood pressure monitoring, and home medication titration can successfully improve blood pressure, and if so, whether this effect persists beyond the period of the intervention.

TI  - Coronary heart disease in moderately hypercholesterolemic, hypertensive black and non-black patients randomized to pravastatin versus usual care: the antihypertensive and lipid lowering to prevent heart attack trial (ALLHAT-LLT).
AB  - BACKGROUND: In previous analyses in ALLHAT, blacks had a significantly lower risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in the pravastatin group compared to the usual care group, whereas non-blacks had no benefit from pravastatin. No previous statin trial has reported results separately in blacks.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to determine if apparent racial differences in CHD in ALLHAT are explained by differences in baseline characteristics, adherence during the trial, or achieved blood pressure and lipid lowering.
AB  - METHODS: This was a prespecified subgroup analysis of a randomized controlled trial. Hypertensive, moderately hypercholesterolemic participants were assigned to open-label pravastatin (40 mg/d) or usual care. The outcome was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD. We performed intention-to-treat survival analyses using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for baseline covariates (age, sex, aspirin use, history of CHD and diabetes, and baseline hypertension treatment) and time-varying levels of blood pressure and total cholesterol.
AB  - RESULTS: After adjustment for baseline characteristics, there remained a significant interaction between race and treatment group (P = .02). In stratified models, blacks in the pravastatin group had a 29% lower risk of CHD (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71, 95% CI 0.57-0.90, P = .005) compared to those in the usual care group, whereas non-blacks had no benefit (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85-1.19, P = .95). With further adjustment for achieved blood pressure and total cholesterol, the HR in blacks was 0.65 (95% CI 0.45-0.96, P = .03) and in non-blacks was 1.07 (95% CI 0.81-1.41, P = .65).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that pravastatin is effective in preventing CHD in blacks.

TI  - Effects of audio relaxation programs for blood pressure reduction in older adults.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stress management is one element of the lifestyle modification that is recommended for blood pressure control. Reduction in sympathetic arousal may be achieved through a series of audio relaxation training.
AB  - AIMS: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the short-term and long-term effects of two audio relaxation programs for blood pressure reduction in older adults.
AB  - METHODS: This clinical randomized study consists of 12-sessions of intervention, with one-month and three-month follow up measures. 41 older adults were randomly assigned to either listening to a 12-minute audio relaxation program or a 12-minute Mozart andante. At each session, blood pressures were recorded.
AB  - RESULTS: For both groups, the reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressures after the 12-session intervention training was statistically and clinically significant. The reduction in systolic blood pressure was greater in the audio relaxation group than the Mozart group. The adherence to the program at one-month and three-month was 54% and 66% respectively. The blood pressure at one-month and three-month were not significantly different than the initial measurement.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Significant blood pressure reduction can be achieved through a brief 12-minute audio relaxation program with older adults. Guided relaxation may be more effective in lowering blood pressure than plain music.

TI  - Physician and pharmacist collaboration to improve blood pressure control.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have demonstrated that blood pressure (BP) control can be improved when clinical pharmacists assist with patient management. The objective of this study was to evaluate if a physician and pharmacist collaborative model in community-based medical offices could improve BP control.
AB  - METHODS: This was a prospective, cluster randomized, controlled clinical trial with clinics randomized to a control group (n = 3) or to an intervention group (n = 3). The study enrolled 402 patients (mean age, 58.3 years) with uncontrolled hypertension. Clinical pharmacists made drug therapy recommendations to physicians based on national guidelines. Research nurses performed BP measurements and 24-hour BP monitoring.
AB  - RESULTS: The mean (SD) guideline adherence scores increased from 49.4 (19.3) at baseline to 53.4 (18.1) at 6 months (8.1% increase) in the control group and from 40.4 (22.6) at baseline to 62.8 (13.5) at 6 months (55.4% increase) in the intervention group (P = .09 for adjusted between-group comparison). The mean BP decreased 6.8/4.5 mm Hg in the control group and 20.7/9.7 mm Hg in the intervention group (P < .05 for between-group systolic BP comparison). The adjusted difference in systolic BP was -12.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], -24.0 to 0.0) mm Hg, while the adjusted difference in diastolic BP was -1.8 (95% CI, -11.9 to 8.3) mm Hg. The 24-hour BP levels showed similar effect sizes. Blood pressure was controlled in 29.9% of patients in the control group and in 63.9% of patients in the intervention group (adjusted odds ratio, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.0-5.1; P < .001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A physician and pharmacist collaborative intervention achieved significantly better mean BP and overall BP control rates compared with a control group. Additional research should be conducted to evaluate efficient strategies to implement team-based chronic disease management.

TI  - Influence of patient race on physician prescribing decisions: a randomized on-line experiment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior research reports black patients have lower medication use for hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and diabetes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether patient race influences physicians' prescribing.
AB  - DESIGN: Web-based survey including three clinical vignettes (hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes), with patient race (black, white) randomized across vignettes.
AB  - SUBJECTS: A total of 716 respondents from 5,141 eligible sampled primary care physicians (14% response rate).
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: None
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: Medication recommendation (any medication vs none, on-patent branded vs generic, and therapeutic class) and physicians' treatment adherence forecast (10-point Likert scale, 1-definitely not adhere, 10-definitely adhere).
AB  - RESULTS: Respondents randomized to view black patients (n = 371) and white patients (n = 345) recommend any medications at comparable rates for hypercholesterolemia (100.0% white vs 99.5% black, P = 0.50), hypertension (99.7% white vs 99.5% black, P = 1.00), and diabetes (99.7% white vs 99.7% black, P = 1.00). Patient race influenced medication class chosen in the hypertension vignette; respondents randomized to view black patients recommended calcium channel blockers more often (20.8% black vs 3.2% white) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors less often (47.4% black vs 62.6% white) (P < 0.001). Patient race did not influence medication class for hypercholesterolemia or diabetes. Respondents randomized to view black patients reported lower forecasted patient adherence for hypertension (P < 0.001, mean: 7.3 black vs 7.7 white) and diabetes (P = 0.05 mean: 7.4 black vs 7.6 white), but race had no meaningful influence on forecasted adherence for hypercholesterolemia (P = 0.15, mean: 7.2 black vs 7.3 white).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Racial differences in outpatient prescribing patterns for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes are likely attributable to factors other than prescribing decisions based on patient race.

TI  - A cluster-randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of culturally-appropriate hypertension education among Afro-Surinamese and Ghanaian patients in Dutch general practice: study protocol.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals of African descent living in western countries have increased rates of hypertension and hypertension-related complications. Poor adherence to hypertension treatment (medication and lifestyle changes) has been identified as one of the most important modifiable causes for the observed disparities in hypertension related complications, with patient education being recommended to improve adherence. Despite evidence that culturally-appropriate patient education may improve the overall quality of care for ethnic minority patients, few studies have focused on how hypertensive individuals of African descent respond to this approach. This paper describes the design of a study that compares the effectiveness of culturally-appropriate hypertension education with that of the standard approach among Surinamese and Ghanaian hypertensive patients with an elevated blood pressure in Dutch primary care practices.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: A cluster-randomized controlled trial will be conducted in four primary care practices in Amsterdam, all offering hypertension care according to Dutch clinical guidelines. After randomization, patients in the usual care sites (n = 2) will receive standard hypertension education. Patients in the intervention sites (n = 2) will receive three culturally-appropriate hypertension education sessions, culturally-specific educational materials and targeted lifestyle support. The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients with a reduction in systolic blood pressure >or= 10 mmHg at eight months after the start of the trial. The secondary outcomes will be the proportion of patients with self-reported adherence to (i) medication and (ii) lifestyle recommendations at eight months after the start of the trial. The study will enrol 148 patients (74 per condition, 37 per site). Eligibility criteria for patients of either sex will be: current diagnosis of hypertension, self-identified Afro-Surinamese or Ghanaian, >or= 20 years, and baseline blood pressure >or= 140/90 mmHg. Primary and secondary outcomes will be measured at baseline and at 3 1/2, 6 1/2, and eight months. Other measurements will be performed at baseline and eight months.
AB  - DISCUSSION: The findings will provide new knowledge on how to improve blood pressure control and patient adherence in ethnic minority persons with a high risk of negative hypertension-related health outcomes.

TI  - Perceived susceptibility to chronic kidney disease among high-risk patients seen in primary care practices.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients' views of their risk for the development or progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are poorly characterized.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess perceived risk and concern regarding CKD development or progression among high-risk patients seen in primary care, identify predictors of perceptions, and correlate perceptions with adherence to high blood pressure management.
AB  - DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study of 195 patients enrolled in a randomized controlled trial on hypertension management in 40 Maryland primary care practices.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: We assessed independent predictors (sociodemographics, health literacy, clinical presence of CKD, co-morbid conditions, and health behaviors) of perceived susceptibility (assessed via questionnaire) and adherence (assessed via Hill-Bone blood pressure adherence scale) in multivariable analyses.
AB  - MAIN RESULTS: In this hypertensive majority African American (63%) population, many participants had uncontrolled blood pressure (44%) or diabetes (42%). Few (20%) felt "very likely" to develop CKD and one third (33%) were "very concerned" about developing CKD. Participants who were female and had low health literacy had lower perceived susceptibility to CKD compared to males and those with higher health literacy. Race and diabetes were also associated with perceived susceptibility. Greater perceived susceptibility was associated with poorer blood pressure management adherence scores.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Many high-risk patients have low perceived susceptibility to CKD. Poor blood pressure therapy adherence scores among those with greatest perceived susceptibility suggest fatalistic attitudes about CKD. If our findings are confirmed in larger studies, interventions targeting patient perceptions of CKD risk and other attitudes associated with these perceptions could impact adherence to therapies and health outcomes.

TI  - Reduced in-hospital mortality for heart failure with clinical pathways: the results of a cluster randomised controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospital treatment of heart failure (HF) frequently does not follow published guidelines, potentially contributing to HF high morbidity, mortality and economic cost. The Experimental Prospective Study on the Effectiveness and Efficiency of the Implementation of Clinical Pathways was undertaken to determine how clinical pathways (CP) for hospital treatment of HF affected care variability, guidelines adherence, in-hospital mortality and outcomes at discharge. Methods/
AB  - DESIGN: Two-arm, cluster-randomised trial. Fourteen community hospitals were randomised either to the experimental arm (CP: appropriate therapeutic guidelines use, new organisation and procedures, patient education) or to the control arm (usual care). The main outcome was in-hospital mortality; secondary outcomes were length and appropriateness of the stay, rate of unscheduled readmissions, customer satisfaction, usage of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures during hospital stay and quality indicators at discharge. All outcomes were measured using validated instruments available in literature.
AB  - RESULTS: In-hospital mortality was 5.6% in the experimental arm (n = 12); 15.4% in controls (n = 33, p = 0.001). In CP and usual care groups, the mean rates of unscheduled readmissions were 7.9% and 13.9%, respectively. Adjusting for age, smoking, New York Heart Association score, hypertension and source of referral, patients in the CP group, as compared to controls, had a significantly lower risk of in-hospital death (OR 0.18; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.46) and unscheduled readmissions (OR 0.42; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.87). No differences were found between CP and control with respect to the appropriateness of the stay, costs and patient's satisfaction. Except for electrocardiography, all recommended diagnostic procedures were used more in the CP group. Similarly, pharmaceuticals use was significantly greater in CP, with the exception of diuretics and anti-platelets agents.
AB  - DISCUSSION: The introduction of a specifically tailored CP for the hospital treatment of HF was effective in reducing in-hospital mortality and unscheduled readmissions. This study adds to previous knowledge indicating that CP should be used to improve the quality of hospital treatment of HF.

TI  - Feasibility of blood pressure telemonitoring in patients with poor blood pressure control.
AB  - We examined the feasibility of using home blood pressure (BP) telemonitoring devices for managing patients with poor BP control. We enrolled 591 subjects with a diagnosis of hypertension. Patients were randomized to usual care (n = 147) or to the intervention arm (n = 441). Those in the intervention arm were issued with a home BP telemonitoring device. The device transmitted BP readings automatically via the home telephone line. Technical alerts were generated if patients did not transmit their BP readings according to the protocol. During the first six months, 693 technical alerts were generated by 267 patients. About half of these patients (112) generated more than two technical alerts. Resolution of the alerts showed that 61% were caused by patient non-adherence. Patients who generated >2 technical alerts were younger (61 vs. 64 years; P = 0.001) and were more likely to be non-Caucasian (64% vs. 47%, P = 0.002) than those generating 2 or fewer alerts. Despite the potential for improving health care using home BP telemonitoring, certain patients will require more support to use the equipment successfully.

TI  - Compound ion salt, a novel low-sodium salt substitute: from animal study to community-based population trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Salt restriction, an important approach for primary and secondary prevention of hypertension, is undermined by unsatisfactory adherence. A salt-restriction study tested the efficacy and safety of a compound ion salt (CISalt) with low sodium content in an animal model and in a community-based population.
AB  - METHODS: In part 1, 8-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were fed 1% CISalt in the study group and 8% or 1% normal salt (NSalt) in controls (n = 10 each) for 12 weeks. Blood pressure (BP) and urinary electrolytes were measured every 3 weeks. After 12 weeks, collagen deposition in the heart and kidney and the levels of angiotensin II (Ang II) and nitric oxide (NO) in plasma and renal cortex were measured. In part 2, a single-blind, randomized, 6-month controlled trial with CISalt was conducted in 248 persons (age >or=65 years) in 10 rural communities. Plasma renin activity and Ang II were included in blood and urinary measures at baseline and 6 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Reduced BP urinary protein excretion and reduced collagen in the heart and kidneys were significantly different in animals fed CISalt compared to controls. In human studies, at 6 months, mean systolic BP (SBP) was decreased by 9.6 mm Hg (95% confidence interval (CI): 13.1 to 6.1, P < 0.001) and diastolic BP (DBP) by 5.3 mm Hg (95% CI: 7.9 to 2.6, P < 0.001), respectively, compared to controls; urinary sodium excretion also decreased by 67.4 mmol/24 h (95% CI: 84.8 to 50.0, P < 0.001), and plasma renin activity was slightly increased by 0.19 ng/ml/h (95% CI: 0.04-0.33, P = 0.013). No adverse cardiovascular events were reported.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In these studies, CISalt lowered BP and showed end-organ protection in hypertensive animals and BP reduction in humans. CISalt appears to be a safe and acceptable strategy to reduce BP.

TI  - Do proton pump inhibitors attenuate the effect of aspirin on platelet aggregation? A randomized crossover study.
AB  - It is common practice to coadminister proton pump inhibitors with aspirin to diminish the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This is the first study that investigated the potential impact of a proton pump inhibitor on aspirin effects on platelet aggregation. Twenty-four hypertensive subjects eligible for treatment with low-dose enteric-coated aspirin (LDECA) for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease were randomized to receive 100 mg LDECA or 100 mg LDECA plus 30 mg lansoprazole for 4 weeks. Then, participants were crossed over to the alternative regimen for another 4 weeks. Salicylic, gastrin, and pepsinogen I blood level counting were used to ensure adherence to treatment. Platelet aggregation was evaluated by light transmittance aggregometry and PFA100. The LDECA administration reduced arachidonic acid (P < 0.001), collagen (P < 0.01), and epinephrine (P < 0.001) tests. These changes paralleled an increase in collagen/epinephrine duration (P < 0.001) but not in collagen/adenosine diphosphate duration and platelet count. No significant difference was found in any of these platelets' function tests with LDECA alone versus LDECA plus lansoprazole. A significant increase in salicylic levels was observed in patients on LDECA as well as in those on LDECA plus lansoprazole, whereas gastrin and pepsinogen I levels were increased only when lansoprazole was added. These data suggest that the concomitant use of the lansoprazole at 30-mg daily does not influence the long-term effect of LDECA on platelet aggregation. Furthermore, they might imply that an interaction of LDECA with other proton pump inhibitors on platelet aggregation is unlikely.

TI  - The effect of patient race and blood pressure control on patient-physician communication.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Racial disparities in hypertension control contribute to higher rates of cardiovascular mortality among blacks. Patient-physician communication quality is associated with better health outcomes, including blood pressure (BP) control. Both race/ethnicity and BP control may adversely affect communication.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether being black and having poor BP control interact to adversely affect patient-physician communication more than either condition alone, a situation referred to as "double jeopardy."
AB  - DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PATIENTS: Cross-sectional study of enrollment data from a randomized controlled trial of interventions to enhance patient adherence to therapy for hypertension. Participants included 226 hypertensive patients and 39 physicians from 15 primary care practices in Baltimore, MD.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: Communication behaviors and visit length from coding of audiotapes.
AB  - RESULTS: After controlling for patient and physician characteristics, blacks with uncontrolled BP have shorter visits (B = -3.9 min, p < 0.01) with less biomedical (B = -24.0, p = 0.05), psychosocial (B = -19.4, p < 0.01), and rapport-building (B = -19.5, p = 0.01) statements than whites with controlled BP. Of all communication outcomes, blacks with uncontrolled BP are only in "double jeopardy" for a patient positive affect-coders give them lower ratings than all other patients. Blacks with controlled BP also experience shorter visits and less communication with physicians than whites with controlled BP. There are no significant communication differences between the visits of whites with uncontrolled versus controlled BP.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that patient race is associated with the quality of patient-physician communication to a greater extent than BP control. Interventions that improve patient-physician communication should be tested as a strategy to reduce racial disparities in hypertension care and outcomes.

TI  - [Non-pharmacological intervention as a strategy to improve antihypertensive treatment compliance]. [Spanish]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of an intervention by means of an educational magazine on treatment compliance in uncontrolled arterial hypertension (AHT).
AB  - DESIGN: Controlled, randomised clinical trial.
AB  - SETTING: 87 primary care centres. Spain.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: A total of 450 patients with uncontrolled hypertension were included.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Two groups of 225 patients were formed: 1) Control group (CG): standard health intervention; 2) Intervention Group (IG): received a twice monthly educational magazine at home.
AB  - MAIN MEASUREMENTS: Compliance was measured using the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS-Aardex). Compliance rate (CR) was recorded. Compliers were defined as individuals with a treatment compliance of 80-110%. The percentage of compliers, the mean percentage of doses taken and the percentage of patients taking the medication at the correct times were estimated. The mean blood pressures (BPs) and the percentage of controlled patientswere calculated. The number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 393 individuals were evaluable (Age: 62.4 years), 196 in the IG and 197 in the CG. There were 83.2% (95% CI 78-88.4) and 49.2% (95% CI 42.2-56.2) (P=0.0001) of overall compliers in the IG and CG, respectively and 74% (95% CI: 67.9-80.1) and 42.6% (95% CI=35.7-49.5) (P=0.0001) of correct times compliers. A total of 81.6% (95% CI=76.2-86.5%)) were controlled in the IG and 56.3% (95% CI=49.4-63.2) in the CG. The NNT was 3.3 patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic non-compliance was very high. The educational magazine is an effective strategy to improve the compliance and degree of control of the AHT.

TI  - [Control of therapeutic inertia in the treatment of arterial hypertension by using different strategies]. [Spanish]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of different interventions on therapeutic Inertia (TI) in mild-to-moderate hypertension (AHT).
AB  - DESIGN: Controlled, randomised clinical trial.
AB  - SETTING: Two hundred clinics in 5 primary care centres. Spain.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1104 patients with uncontrolled hypertension were included.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Four groups with 276 patients were formed: 1) Control group (CG): standard health intervention; 2) Education intervention and a program of home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) (EG); 3) Card control intervention and HBPM programme (CHG); 4) Education intervention, card control and HBPM programme (ECHG).
AB  - MAIN MEASUREMENTS: TI was calculated by the rate: (Number of patients whose pharmacological treatment was not changed in each visit/Number of patients with an average BP 140mmHg and/or 90mmHg in the general population or 130 and/or 90 mmHg in diabetics). The mean BPs and the percentage of controlled patients were calculated. The mean number of people that required an intervention in order to avoid TI was calculated (NI).
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 921 patients completed the study, and 1842 visits were made, with TI in 36.8% (IC=5.8%) of the sample and in 82.58% (IC=8.2%) of the uncontrolled hypertensive patients. The TI was 60% (CI=4.2%), 38.4% (CI=4.4%) 30.2 (CI=4.3%) and 14.7 (CI=3.3%) (p=0.001) for CG, EG, CHG and ECHG, respectively. The percentage controlled at the end of study was 35.3% (CI=1.1%), 54.7% (CI=1.8%), 60.2% (CI=2.1%) and 65.1% (CI=2.2%) (p<0.01) for CG, EG, CHG and ECHG, respectively. The NI were 4.6, 3.3 and 2.2 for CG, EG, CHG and ECHG, respectively.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: TI was very significant among the uncontrolled hypertensive patients. The studied interventions are effective for improving TI.

TI  - Implementing a palm pilot intervention for primary care providers: lessons learned.
AB  - The Personal Digital Assistance for Guideline Adherence (GLAD Heart) study was designed to test a strategy to improve quality of care through increased adherence to ATPIII cholesterol guidelines. This paper describes the overall study design including the multi-faceted intervention and outcome measures. Sixty-one primary care practices in NC were recruited and randomized to either a personal digital assistant-based cholesterol management intervention or an intervention similar in intensity and frequency of contact but focused on a hypertension clinical practice guideline. Installation and implementation of the technology intervention was challenging. Over the course of the study, there were 74 technical issues requiring assistance for the palm pilot from 23 participating practices. The GLAD Heart project was completed successfully with some impact on cholesterol management. Technology has the potential to improve the quality of care provided in the healthcare setting. However, potentially expensive interventions such as that conducted in GLAD Heart should undergo rigorous testing to assure their efficacy before widespread adoption.

TI  - Rationale and design of the Study Assessing the Effect of Cardiovascular Medications Provided as Low-cost, Evidence-based Generic Samples (SAMPLES) trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Highly effective generic cardiovascular medications are frequently underused, leading to greater overall drug costs and cost-related nonadherence.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess an intervention to stimulate appropriate generic cardiovascular drug use without creating administrative or financial barriers that may impede essential medication use.
AB  - TRIAL DESIGN: The SAMPLES (Study Assessing the Effect of Cardiovascular Medications Provided as Low-cost, Evidence-based Generic Samples) trial is a clustered, randomized controlled trial of the effect of providing physicians with free generic samples of hydrochlorothiazide for hypertensive patients and simvastatin for patients with hyperlipidemia. We will randomize 660 primary care physicians in Pennsylvania, clustered by physician practice, to receive free samples for both conditions or to receive no samples. We will use data on filled prescriptions obtained from a state-sponsored prescription drug assistance program to perform an intention-to-treat evaluation of the impact of the intervention on physician prescribing behavior (proportion of prescriptions that are generic) and patient adherence. Secondary outcomes will include physician adherence to established guidelines and overall prescription drug costs.
AB  - CONCLUSION: This trial will define the potential role of an innovative approach to stimulate clinically appropriate cost-effective prescribing. We will determine whether free generic samples can reduce overall drug costs as well as out-of-pocket costs to the patient without sacrificing efficacy and whether this approach results in improved adherence to essential cardiovascular medications. This intervention may also improve adherence to practice guidelines and improve the quality of care received. If effective, this strategy could be used broadly by private insurers or government payers aiming to stimulate more cost-effective and higher-quality care.

TI  - Medication acquisition and self-reported adherence in veterans with hypertension.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine factors associated with oversupply and undersupply of antihypertensive medication, and examine evidence for medication acquisition as distinct from self-reported adherence.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN: Analysis of pharmacy refill records, medical charts, and in-person interviews.
AB  - SUBJECTS: Five hundred sixty-two male veterans with hypertension enrolled in a randomized controlled trial to improve BP control.
AB  - MEASURES: Patients were classified as having undersupply (<0.80), appropriate supply (> or = 0.80 and < or = 1.20), or oversupply (>1.20) of antihypertensive medication in the 90 days before trial enrollment based on the ReComp algorithm. Determination of BP control was based on clinic measurements at enrollment. Demographic, clinical, psychosocial, and behavioral factors relevant to medication-taking behavior and BP were assessed at enrollment.
AB  - RESULTS: Twenty-three percent of the patients had undersupply, 47% had appropriate supply, and 30% had oversupply of antihypertensive medication. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that using fewer classes of antihypertensive medications and greater perceived adherence barriers were independently associated with greater likelihood of undersupply. Current employment was associated with decreased likelihood of oversupply, and greater comorbidity and being married were associated with increased likelihood of oversupply. Agreement between ReComp and self-reported adherence was poor (kappa = 0.19, P < 0.001). Undersupply, oversupply, and self-reported nonadherence were all independently associated with decreased likelihood of BP control after adjusting for each other and patient factors.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Antihypertensive oversupply was common and may arise from different circumstances than undersupply. Measures of medication acquisition and self-reported adherence appear to provide distinct, complementary information about patients' medication-taking behavior.

TI  - Impact of supportive measures on drug adherence in patients with essential hypertension treated with valsartan: the randomized, open-label, parallel group study VALIDATE.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The majority of treated hypertensive patients do not achieve target blood pressure (BP) levels of less than 140/90 mmHg. One key reason is inadequate adherence with the prescribed drug regimen. Dosing regimens are either not executed as prescribed (noncompliance) or patients stop taking the medication (nonpersistence). It has been demonstrated that adherence with angiotensin receptor antagonists such as valsartan is high due to the tolerability profile of this drug class. The present study was designed to evaluate whether drug adherence could further be improved by the use of supportive measures.
AB  - DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-eight centers were randomized to provide pharmacological treatment with or without a set of supportive measures (e.g. structured physician-patient interaction, printed information about hypertension, reminder stickers, 24 h timer, and home BP measurement device). Two hundred and two patients with grade 1 hypertension (BP at baseline 149.8 +/- 6.2/93.9 +/- 4.4 mmHg) who were either newly diagnosed or who had not been treated for at least 1 year were included in this trial. All patients entered the 34-week treatment phase with valsartan 160 mg daily. Titration to valsartan 160 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg was allowed if necessary. Drug adherence was assessed by electronic monitors (Medication Event Monitoring System).
AB  - RESULTS: Patients treated with a valsartan-based therapy receiving supportive measures as compared with the standard care group demonstrated an initially higher level of adherence with a maximum absolute difference of 7.8% (P = 0.041). This difference did not persist over the observation period but faded with time. In parallel, execution of the dosing regimen (compliance) was also improved in the intervention group during the early months of treatment but this effect also disappeared by the end of the observation period. In contrast, persistence in the two groups slowly but continuously separated over time. Estimated absolute difference in persistence at the end of the 34-weeks study between the two groups was 7.6% (95.9 vs. 88.3%) reflecting a 66% lower hazard of discontinuation in the intervention group (P = 0.073). BP control improved more in patients with the supportive measures.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Drug adherence improved initially with the use of supportive measures. However, this effect faded with time mainly because of the short-lived improvement in the quality of execution (compliance) achieved. In contrast, a longer lasting effect of the chosen supportive measures on persistence could be demonstrated, which, however, at least under the conditions of the present study, did not translate into a persistent improvement of medication adherence.

TI  - Evaluation of a hypertension medication therapy management program in patients with diabetes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a 9-month community pharmacy-based medication therapy management (MTM) program on quality of care in patients with diabetes and hypertension.
AB  - DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.
AB  - SETTING: Tulsa, OK, between November 2005 and July 2007.
AB  - PATIENTS: 52 patients with diabetes and hypertension who were enrolled in a managed care organization.
AB  - INTERVENTION: During monthly visits, intervention group participants received MTM services for hypertension and diabetes management.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Systolic blood pressure (SBP), percentage at goal blood pressure (<130/80 mm Hg), and antihypertensive medication adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: The mean intervention group SBP decreased 17.32 mm Hg, whereas the mean control group SBP level increased 2.73 mm Hg (P = 0.003). The percentage of patients at goal blood pressure increased from 16.0% to 48.0% in the intervention group and decreased from 20.0% to 6.67% in the control group. Intervention group participants were 12.92 times more likely than control group participants to achieve goal blood pressure (P = 0.021). Although the mean adherence rate in the intervention group increased 7.0% while remaining fairly constant in the control group (-0.7%), this group difference was not statistically significant.
AB  - CONCLUSION: A community pharmacy-based hypertension MTM program was effective in improving blood pressure control among managed care enrollees with diabetes and hypertension. Community pharmacists are strategically positioned to provide MTM services and effectively communicate with providers to improve quality of care for patients.

TI  - Hypertension Improvement Project (HIP): study protocol and implementation challenges.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension affects 29% of the adult U.S. population and is a leading cause of heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Despite numerous effective treatments, only 53% of people with hypertension are at goal blood pressure. The chronic care model suggests that blood pressure control can be achieved by improving how patients and physicians address patient self-care.
AB  - METHODS AND DESIGN: This paper describes the protocol of a nested 2 x 2 randomized controlled trial to test the separate and combined effects on systolic blood pressure of a behavioral intervention for patients and a quality improvement-type intervention for physicians. Primary care practices were randomly assigned to the physician intervention or to the physician control condition. Physician randomization occurred at the clinic level. The physician intervention included training and performance monitoring. The training comprised 2 internet-based modules detailing both the JNC-7 hypertension guidelines and lifestyle modifications for hypertension. Performance data were collected for 18 months, and feedback was provided to physicians every 3 months. Patient participants in both intervention and control clinics were individually randomized to the patient intervention or to usual care. The patient intervention consisted of a 6-month behavioral intervention conducted by trained interventionists in 20 group sessions, followed by 12 monthly phone contacts by community health advisors. Follow-up measurements were performed at 6 and 18 months. The primary outcome was the mean change in systolic blood pressure at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were diastolic blood pressure and the proportion of patients with adequate blood pressure control at 6 and 18 months.
AB  - DISCUSSION: Overall, 8 practices (4 per treatment group), 32 physicians (4 per practice; 16 per treatment group), and 574 patients (289 control and 285 intervention) were enrolled. Baseline characteristics of patients and providers and the challenges faced during study implementation are presented. The HIP interventions may improve blood pressure control and lower cardiovascular disease risk in a primary care practice setting by addressing key components of the chronic care model. The study design allows an assessment of the effectiveness and cost of physician and patient interventions separately, so that health care organizations can make informed decisions about implementation of 1 or both interventions in the context of local resources.

TI  - Comparison of methods to assess medication adherence and classify nonadherence.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication adherence is suboptimal, and clinicians and researchers struggle with identifying nonadherent patients. Various measures of medication adherence exist, but there is controversy regarding which measures provide acceptable data and how nonadherence should be defined.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess agreement among patient self-report, pharmacy refill, and electronic adherence measures and compare the sensitivity and specificity of different cut-points for defining nonadherence.
AB  - METHODS: Data were analyzed from 2 similarly designed randomized controlled trials that assessed a pharmacist's intervention to improve medication adherence among patients with hypertension or heart failure. For each participant, adherence was measured by patient self-report, prescription refill records, and electronic lids on medication containers. Agreement among measures was assessed using Spearman's correlation coefficient rho. Correlation coefficients were compared by patient characteristics using Fisher's Z transformation. The sensitivity and specificity of different cut-points for defining nonadherence were calculated.
AB  - RESULTS: Median adherence was 84% for self-report, 86% for electronic, and 91% for prescription refill adherence measurement. Refill and electronic adherence demonstrated the best agreement among measures (rho = 0.48). Age, depression, and other comorbid conditions influenced agreement among measures. Measures were generally in agreement, regardless of how nonadherence was defined. A cut-point of 80% illustrated a fair balance between sensitivity and specificity for all measures.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: All measures provided similar estimates of overall adherence, although refill and electronic measures were in highest agreement. In selection of a measure, practitioners should consider population and disease characteristics, since measurement agreement could be influenced by these and other factors. The commonly used, clinically based cut-point of 80% had a reasonable balance between sensitivity and specificity in studies of adherence in patients with heart failure or hypertension.

TI  - Patient education and provider decision support to control blood pressure in primary care: a cluster randomized trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Less than one third of the 65 million Americans with hypertension have adequate blood pressure (BP) control. This study examined the effectiveness of 2 interventions for improving patient BP control.
AB  - METHODS: This was a 2-level (primary care provider and patient) cluster randomized trial with 2-year follow-up occurring among patients with hypertension enrolled from a Veterans Affairs Medical Center primary care clinic. Primary care providers (n = 17) in the intervention received computer-generated decision support designed to improve guideline concordant medical therapy at each visit; control providers (n = 15) received a reminder at each visit. Patients received usual care or a bimonthly tailored nurse-delivered behavioral telephone intervention to improve hypertension treatment. The primary outcome was proportion of patients who achieved a BP <140/90 mm Hg (<130/85 for diabetic patients) over the 24-month intervention.
AB  - RESULTS: Of the 816 eligible patients contacted, 190 refused and 38 were excluded. The 588 enrolled patients had a mean age of 63 years, 43% had adequate baseline BP control, and 482 (82%) completed the 24-month follow-up. There were no significant differences in amount of change in BP control in the 3 intervention groups as compared to the hypertension reminder control group. In secondary analyses, rates of BP control for all patients receiving the patient behavioral intervention (n = 294) improved from 40.1% to 54.4% at 24 months (P = .03); patients in the nonbehavioral intervention group improved from 38.2% to 43.9% (P = .38), but there was no between-group differences at the end of the study.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The brief behavioral intervention showed improved outcomes over time, but there were not significant between group differences.

TI  - A multifaceted intervention to improve blood pressure control: The Guideline Adherence for Heart Health (GLAD) study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although high blood pressure is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, the proportion reaching the goal blood pressures as outlined in the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) is low. We conducted a randomized trial in primary care practices of a multifactorial intervention targeted to improve providers' adherence to hypertension guidelines.
AB  - METHOD: A total of 61 primary care practices in North Carolina were randomized to receive either a multifactorial intervention (guideline dissemination via a continuing medical education session, academic detailing sessions, audit and feedback on preintervention rates of adherence, and automated blood pressure machines) or an attention control of similar magnitude but targeted at a different guideline. Outcomes were determined through review of patient charts conducted by an independent masked quality assurance organization.
AB  - RESULTS: We found no difference between the 2 groups in any of the adherence measures including no difference in the percentage of patients at goal (intervention 49.2%, control 50.6%), with undiagnosed hypertension (18.1% vs 13.6%), average systolic (126 vs 125.1 mm Hg), or diastolic blood pressure (73.1 vs 73.4 mm Hg). Similarly, there was no difference in provider adherence to treatment recommendations (use of thiazide-type diuretic as first-line therapy: 32% vs 29.5%; use of 2-drug therapy in stage 2 hypertension: 11.3% vs 10.4%).
AB  - CONCLUSION: An intensive, multifactorial intervention did not improve adherence to national hypertension guidelines among community-based primary care. Efforts should be focused on other types of interventions to improve rates of control of hypertension.

TI  - Can individuals meet multiple physical activity and dietary behavior goals?.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine whether participants with the most behavioral goals to achieve were more likely to meet more goals than those given fewer goals.
AB  - METHODS: Eight hundred ten participants were randomly assigned to advice-only, established guidelines for blood pressure control (reduced sodium, increased physical activity), or established guidelines plus the DASH diet (increased fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy, reduced fat).
AB  - RESULTS: At 6 months, 11.7% of Advice-Only, 19.3% of Established, and 44.6% of Established plus DASH met at least 3 goals (P<0.0001). At 18 months, 33.5% of Established plus DASH met at least 3 goals.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Those with the most goals to achieve reached the most goals.

TI  - Control of blood pressure in North Carolina primary care: baseline data from the GLAD Heart Trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In general, adherence to blood pressure guidelines is low. We assessed whether hypertension recognition and control in North Carolina was consistent with the seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) in primary care practices participating in a quality improvement study regarding the implementation of the ATP3 cholesterol management guideline in primary care in North Carolina (GLAD Heart).
AB  - METHODS: Demographic and clinical data were abstracted from 5,073 charts (patients aged 21-84 years, seen from June 1, 2001 to May 31, 2003) at 60 practices. Sites were non-university based primary care practices from 22 North Carolina counties. A dyslipidemia screening was defined as a lipid profile performed when not on lipid-lowering therapy. Among patients receiving a lipid profile, the proportion with diagnosed, undiagnosed, and controlled hypertension, was calculated according to JNC 7 guidelines. Practice level hypertension control was examined using the median and interquartile range across practices.
AB  - RESULTS: Among 1,763 patients screened for dyslipidemia, 49.4% had diagnosed hypertension. Only 67 individuals (3.8%) had undiagnosed hypertension. Although 85.8% of hypertensive patients were treated, the median proportions of patients with blood pressure below goal (< 140/90, < 130/80 with diabetes) was 33.3% (21.8%-43.7%), with women more likely to be controlled and individuals treated by a solo provider less likely to be controlled.
AB  - LIMITATIONS: These data were abstracted from the charts of patients who received a lipid profile; therefore, they are only generalizable to individuals who are screened for hyperlipidemia.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: There remains a need to improve hypertension management in North Carolina primary care among patients screened for hyperlipidemia.

TI  - Prescription pattern of anti-hypertensive drugs in a tertiary health institution in Nigeria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined the pattern of physicians' prescription of antihypertensive drugs and its possible effects on blood pressure control as well as physicians' compliance with recommended guidelines.
AB  - METHODS: Records of 145 patients aged 17-91 (mean: 52.6+/-14.6) years, with male to female ratio of 1:1.2 were randomly selected. Information on antihypertensive prescriptions was recorded. Blood pressure control was defined as systolic and diastolic blood pressure less than 140 mm Hg and 90 mmHg, respectively.
AB  - RESULTS: Of the 145 patients studied, 20% (29) were on monotherapy and 80% (116) on combination therapy. Of the patients on combination therapy, 61.2% (71), 33.6% (39) and 5.2% (6) were on 2, 3 and 4 drugs, respectively. Diuretic was the most frequently p rescribed drug either as a single agent (44.8%) or as combination therapy (88.8%). Mean reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were more in patients on calcium channel blocker than those on diuretic monotherapy (t=2.5 and 3.6 for reductions in systolic and diastolic BP, respectively; P<.05 for both), and, in patients on combination therapy than those on monotherapy (t=3.64 and 3.27 for reductions in systolic and diastolic BP, respectively; P<.01 for both). Blood pressure control rate was 30.5%.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Our results are consistent with the previously observed benefits of antihypertensive combination therapy, and demonstrate an apparent higher efficacy of calcium channel blocker monotherapy than diuretic monotherapy in blood pressure lowering in the study population. Major limitations of this work include its retrospective nature and the inability to determine the actual patients' adherence to therapy.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of team-based care: impact of physician-pharmacist collaboration on uncontrolled hypertension.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the effectiveness of collaborative management of hypertension by primary care-pharmacist teams in community-based clinics.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A 12-month prospective, single-blind, randomized, controlled trial in the Providence Primary Care Research Network of patients with hypertension and uncontrolled blood pressure.
AB  - METHODS: As compared to usual primary care, intervention consisted of pharmacy practitioners participating in the active management of hypertension in the primary care office according to established collaborative treatment protocols. At baseline, there was no significant difference in blood pressure between groups. Primary outcome measures were the differences in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures between arms at study end. Secondary measures included blood pressure goal attainment (<140/90 mmHg), hypertension-related knowledge, medication adherence, home blood pressure monitoring, resource utilization, quality of life, and satisfaction.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 463 subjects were enrolled (n = 233 control, n = 230 intervention). Subjects receiving the intervention achieved significantly lower systolic (p = 0.007) and diastolic (p = 0.002) blood pressures compared to control (137/75 mmHg vs. 143/78 mmHg). In addition, 62% of intervention subjects achieved target blood pressure compared to 44% of control subjects (p = 0.003). The intervention group received more total office visits (7.2 vs. 4.9, p < 0.0001), however had fewer physician visits (3.2 vs. 4.7, p < 0.0001) compared to control. Intervention subjects were prescribed more antihypertensive medications (2.7 vs. 2.4, p = 0.02), but did not take more antihypertensive pills per day (2.4 vs. 2.5, p = 0.87). There were minimal differences between groups in hypertension-related knowledge, medication adherence, quality of life, or satisfaction.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Patients randomized to collaborative primary care-pharmacist hypertension management achieved significantly better blood pressure control compared to usual care with no difference in quality of life or satisfaction.

TI  - A senior center-based pilot trial of the effect of lifestyle intervention on blood pressure in minority elderly people with hypertension.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To test the feasibility, acceptability, and effect of a senior center-based behavioral counseling lifestyle intervention on systolic blood pressure (BP).
AB  - DESIGN: A pre-post design pilot trial of behavioral counseling for therapeutic lifestyle changes in minority elderly people with hypertension. Participants completed baseline visit, Visit 1 (approximately 6 weeks postbaseline), and a final study Visit 2 (approximately 14 weeks postbaseline) within 4 months.
AB  - SETTING: The study took place in six community-based senior centers in New York City with 65 seniors (mean age 72.29+/-6.92; 53.8% female; 84.6% African American).
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-five minority elderly people.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Six weekly and two monthly "booster" group sessions on lifestyle changes to improve BP (e.g., diet, exercise, adherence to prescribed antihypertensive medications).
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcome was systolic BP (SBP) measured using an automated BP monitor. Secondary outcomes were diastolic BP (DBP), physical activity, diet, and adherence to prescribed antihypertensive medications.
AB  - RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in average SBP of 13.0+/-21.1 mmHg for the intervention group (t(25)=3.14, P=.004) and a nonsignificant reduction in mean SBP of 10.6+/-30.0 mmHg for the waitlist control group (t(29)=1.95, P=.06). For the intervention group, adherence improved 26% (t(23)=2.31, P=.03), and vegetable intake improved 23% (t(25)=2.29, P=.03).
AB  - CONCLUSION: This senior center-based lifestyle intervention was associated with a significant reduction in SBP and adherence to prescribed antihypertensive medications and diet in the intervention group. Participant retention and group attendance rates suggest that implementing a group-counseling intervention in senior centers is feasible.

TI  - Alcohol screening scores and medication nonadherence.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication nonadherence is common and is associated with adverse outcomes. Alcohol misuse may be a risk factor for nonadherence; however, evidence is limited.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify whether alcohol misuse, as identified by a simple screening tool, is associated in a dose-response manner with increased risk for medication nonadherence in veterans attending primary care clinics.
AB  - DESIGN: Secondary analysis of cohort data collected prospectively from 1997 to 2000 as part of a randomized, controlled trial.
AB  - SETTING: 7 Veterans Affairs primary care clinics.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: 5473 patients taking a statin, 3468 patients taking oral hypoglycemic agents, and 13 729 patients taking antihypertensive medications.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: Patients completed the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) questionnaire, a validated 3-question alcohol misuse screening test. Their scores were categorized into nondrinkers; low-level alcohol use; and mild, moderate, and severe alcohol misuse. Medication adherence, defined as having medications available for at least 80% of the observation days, was measured from pharmacy records for either 90 days or 1 year after the alcohol screening date. Logistic regression was used to estimate the predicted proportions of adherent patients in each AUDIT-C group and adjusted for demographic and clinical covariates.
AB  - RESULTS: The proportion of patients treated for hypertension and hyperlipidemia who were nonadherent increased with higher AUDIT-C scores. For 1-year adherence to statins, the percentage of adherent patients was lower in the 2 highest alcohol misuse groups (adjusted percentage of adherent patients, 58% [95% CI, 52% to 65%] and 55% [CI, 47% to 63%]) than in the nondrinker group (66% [CI, 64% to 68%]). For 1-year adherence to antihypertensive regimens, the percentage of adherent patients was lower in the 3 highest alcohol misuse groups (adjusted percentage of adherent patients, 61% [CI, 58% to 64%]; 60% [CI, 56% to 63%]; and 56% [CI, 52% to 60%]) than in the nondrinker group (64% [CI, 63% to 65%]). No statistically significant differences were observed for oral hypoglycemics in adjusted analyses.
AB  - LIMITATION: This observational study cannot address whether changes in drinking lead to changes in adherence and may not be generalizable to other populations.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Alcohol misuse, as measured by a brief screening questionnaire, was associated with increased risk for medication nonadherence.

TI  - Impact of patient-general practitioner short-messages-based interaction on the control of hypertension in a follow-up service for low-to-medium risk hypertensive patients: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - The evaluation in real-life settings of services for the follow-up and control of hypertensive patients is a complex intervention, which still needs analysis of the roles, tasks, and resources involved in the basic items: patient, healthcare professional, and the interaction between the two. To evaluate the impact of patient-general practitioner (GP) short-messages-based interaction, isolated from other items, on the degree of hypertension control in the follow-up of medium-to-low-risk patients in primary care, a randomized controlled trial has been performed: 38 GPs enrolled 285 hypertensive patients who recorded the results of self-blood-pressure (BP) monitoring, heart rate, and body weight, and completed an optional questionnaire in an identical manner over a six-month period. The telemedicine group (TmG) sent the data to a telemedicine-based system that enabled patient-GP interaction; the control group (CG) recorded the data on paper and could only deliver it to their GP personally in the routine visits. In the TmG, the results were better, but not significantly so, for: 1) degree of hypertension control, in terms of the percentage of uncontrolled hypertensives at the final visit (TmG versus CG: 31.7% versus 35.6%; p = 0.47); 2) reduction in hypertension during follow-up, comparing measurements (performed by a professional) at the initial and final visits of systolic BP (15.5 versus 11.9; p = 0.13) and diastolic BP (9.6 versus 4.4; p = 0.40); and 3) adherence to the protocol within compliance levels of interest in a real-life follow-up service: >>50% (84.8% versus 73.3%) and >>25% (92.4.8% versus 75.4%) ( p = 0.053). Other factors such as average values of self-measured systolic BP, diastolic BP and heart rate, acceptability of the protocol, and median number of consultations and hospital admissions were similar in both groups. Outcomes show that, taken alone, the patient-GP short-messages-based interaction has very little impact on the degree of hypertension control in patients with this profile. In complex interventions, to discriminate the impact of each of its components in isolation will enable us to design an efficient follow-up service, little demanding in terms of healthcare professional dedication, and optimized in other basic aspects.

TI  - Impact of electronic monitoring of drug adherence on blood pressure control in primary care: a cluster 12-month randomised controlled study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor long-term adherence is an important cause of uncontrolled hypertension. We examined whether monitoring drug adherence with an electronic system improves long-term blood pressure (BP) control in hypertensive patients followed by general practitioners (GPs).
AB  - METHODS: A pragmatic cluster randomised controlled study was conducted over one year in community pharmacists/GPs' networks randomly assigned either to usual care (UC) where drugs were dispensed as usual, or to intervention (INT) group where drug adherence could be monitored with an electronic system (Medication Event Monitoring System). No therapy change was allowed during the first 2 months in both groups. Thereafter, GPs could modify therapy and use electronic monitors freely in the INT group. The primary outcome was a target office BP<140/90 mmHg.
AB  - RESULTS: Sixty-eight treated uncontrolled hypertensive patients (UC: 34; INT: 34) were enrolled. Over the 12-month period, the likelihood of reaching the target BP was higher in the INT group compared to the UC group (p<0.05). At 4 months, 38% in the INT group reached the target BP vs. 12% in the UC group (p<0.05), and 21% vs. 9% at 12 months (p: ns). Multivariate analyses, taking account of baseline characteristics, therapy modification during follow-up, and clustering effects by network, indicate that being allocated to the INT group was associated with a greater odds of reaching the target BP at 4 months (p<0.01) and at 12 months (p=0.051).
AB  - CONCLUSION: GPs monitoring drug adherence in collaboration with pharmacists achieved a better BP control in hypertensive patients, although the impact of monitoring decreased with time.

TI  - Adherence to a Mediterranean-type diet and reduced prevalence of clustered cardiovascular risk factors in a cohort of 3,204 high-risk patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Mediterranean food pattern (MeDiet) has been suggested to have beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors. Scarcity of assessment of this effect on large samples of patients at high risk is, however, observed. Our objective was to estimate the association between adherence to MeDiet and the prevalence of risk factors in 3,204 asymptomatic high-risk patients.
AB  - DESIGN: Cross-sectional assessment of baseline characteristics of participants in a primary prevention trial.
AB  - METHODS: Participants were assessed by their usual primary-care physicians to ascertain the prevalence of diet-related cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or obesity) using standard diagnostic criteria. A dietitian interviewed each participant to obtain a 14-point score measuring the degree of adherence to MeDiet.
AB  - RESULTS: Adherence to MeDiet was inversely associated with individual risk factors and, above all, with the clustering of them. The multivariate adjusted odds ratio to present simultaneously the four risk factors for those above the median value of the MeDiet score was 0.67 (95% confidence interval: 0.53-0.85). The multivariate odds ratios for successive categories of adherence to MeDiet were 1 (ref.), 1.03, 0.85, 0.70 and 0.54 (P for trend <0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Following a MeDiet was inversely associated with the clustering of hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and hypercholesterolemia among high-risk patients.

TI  - A practice-based trial of motivational interviewing and adherence in hypertensive African Americans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor medication adherence is a significant problem in hypertensive African Americans. Although motivational interviewing (MINT) is effective for adoption and maintenance of health behaviors in patients with chronic diseases, its effect on medication adherence remains untested in this population.
AB  - METHODS: This randomized controlled trial tested the effect of a practice-based MINT counseling vs. usual care (UC) on medication adherence and blood pressure (BP) in 190 hypertensive African Americans (88% women; mean age 54 years). Patients were recruited from two community-based primary care practices in New York City. The primary outcome was adherence measured by electronic pill monitors; the secondary outcome was within-patient change in office BP from baseline to 12 months.
AB  - RESULTS: Baseline adherence was similar in both groups (56.2 and 56.6% for MINT and UC, respectively, P = 0.94). Based on intent-to-treat analysis using mixed-effects regression, a significant time x group interaction with model-predicted posttreatment adherence rates of 43 and 57% were found in the UC and MINT groups, respectively (P = 0.027), with a between-group difference of 14% (95% confidence interval, -0.2 to -27%). The between-group difference in systolic and diastolic BP was -6.1 mm Hg (P = 0.065) and -1.4 mm Hg (P = 0.465), respectively, in favor of the MINT group.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A practice-based MINT counseling led to steady maintenance of medication adherence over time, compared to significant decline in adherence for UC patients. This effect was associated with a modest, nonsignificant trend toward a net reduction in systolic BP in favor of the MINT group.

TI  - Effects of strict blood pressure control by a long-acting calcium channel blocker on brain natriuretic peptide and urinary albumin excretion rate in Japanese hypertensive patients.
AB  - Strong adherence to antihypertensive therapy has been shown to reduce the frequency of cardiovascular events by strictly controlling blood pressure. Although calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are among the most popular antihypertensive drugs in Japan, few trials have been conducted using high CCB doses in Japanese patients. In this study, we administered amlodipine 5 mg or 10 mg to patients with hypertension in order to compare the efficacy and tolerability of low and high doses, and measured two surrogate markers of hypertensive target organ damage, i.e., brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) as a risk marker of cardiac overload and microalbuminuria as a measure of renal damage. Seventy-two patients were randomly assigned to either amlodipine 5 mg (n = 35) or 10 mg (n = 37) dose groups. The latter group achieved greater reductions in clinic as well as both morning and evening home BP levels without an increase in pulse rate (the differences between the two groups in clinic/morning/evening systolic BP were 4.7/4.7/5.4 mmHg, and for diastolic BP they were 4.2/3.6/3.8 mmHg). Reductions in BNP and urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UAR) levels were significantly correlated with the reductions in systolic BP levels (BNP, clinic/morning BP: r = 0.256, p = 0.030/r = 0.330, p = 0.005; UAR, clinic BP: r = 0.316, p = 0.007). In conclusion, the higher dose (10 mg) of amlodipine induced greater reductions in all BP levels than did the lower dose, without increasing the pulse rate. These additional reductions were significantly correlated with reductions in hypertensive cardiac overload, as evaluated by BNP levels, and a reduction in renal damage, as evaluated by microalbuminuria levels. Moreover, a reduction in the microalbuminuria may have occurred concomitant with a reduction in clinic systolic BP level.

TI  - Integration of depression and hypertension treatment: a pilot, randomized controlled trial.
AB  - PURPOSE: We wanted to examine whether integrating depression treatment into care for hypertension improved adherence to antidepressant and antihypertensive medications, depression outcomes, and blood pressure control among older primary care patients.
AB  - METHODS: Older adults prescribed pharmacotherapy for depression and hypertension from physicians at a large primary care practice in West Philadelphia were randomly assigned to an integrated care intervention or usual care. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 weeks using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) to assess depression, an electronic monitor to measure blood pressure, and the Medication Event Monitoring System to assess adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: In all, 64 participants aged 50 to 80 years participated. Participants in the integrated care intervention had fewer depressive symptoms (CES-D mean scores, intervention 9.9 vs usual care 19.3; P <.01), lower systolic blood pressure (intervention 127.3 mm Hg vs usual care 141.3 mm Hg; P <.01), and lower diastolic blood pressure (intervention 75.8 mm Hg vs usual care 85.0 mm Hg; P <.01) compared with participants in the usual care group at 6 weeks. Compared with the usual care group, the proportion of participants in the intervention group who had 80% or greater adherence to an antidepressant medication (intervention 71.9% vs usual care 31.3%; P <.01) and to an antihypertensive medication (intervention 78.1% vs usual care 31.3%; P <.001) was greater at 6 weeks.
AB  - CONCLUSION: A pilot, randomized controlled trial integrating depression and hypertension treatment was successful in improving patient outcomes. Integrated interventions may be more feasible and effective in real-world practices, where there are competing demands for limited resources.

TI  - CRISTOPH - a cluster-randomised intervention study to optimise the treatment of patients with hypertension in General Practice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent guidelines for the management of hypertension focus on treating patients according to their global cardiovascular risk (CVR), rather than strictly keeping blood pressure, or other risk factors, below set limit values. The objective of this study is to compare the effect of a simple versus a complex educational intervention implementing this new concept among General Practitioners (GPs).
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: A prospective longitudinal cluster-randomised intervention trial with 94 German GPs consecutively enroling 40 patients each with known hypertension. All GPs then received a written manual specifically developed to transfer the global concept of CVR into daily General Practice. After cluster-randomisation, half of the GPs additionally received a clinical outreach visit, with a trained peer discussing with them the concept of global CVR referring to example study patients from the respective GP. Main outcome measure is the improvement of calculated CVR six months after intervention in the subgroup of patients with high CVR (but no history of cardiovascular disease), defined as 10-year-mortality > or = 5% employing the European SCORE formula. Secondary outcome measures include the intervention's effect on single risk factors, and on prescription rates of drugs targeting CVR. All outcome measures are separately studied in the three subgroups of patients with 1. high CVR (defined as above), 2. low CVR (SCORE < 5%), and 3. a history of cardiovascular disease. The influence of age, sex, social status, and the perceived quality of the respective doctor-patient-relation on the effects will be examined.
AB  - DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, no other published intervention study has yet evaluated the impact of educating GPs with the goal to treat patients with hypertension according to their global cardiovascular risk.

TI  - Adiponectin plasma levels are increased by atorvastatin treatment in subjects at high cardiovascular risk.
AB  - Adiponectin can suppress atherogenesis by inhibiting the adherence of monocytes, reducing their phagocytic activity, and suppressing the accumulation of modified lipoproteins in the vascular wall. Contradictory data have been reported about the effect of statins on adiponectin plasma levels. In this work, adiponectin plasma levels were measured in 102 statin-free subjects from the Spanish population of the Achieve Cholesterol Targets Fast with Atorvastatin Stratified Titration (ACTFAST) study, a 12-week, prospective, multi-centre, open-label trial which enrolled subjects with coronary heart disease, coronary heart disease-equivalent or a 10-year coronary heart disease risk >20%. Subjects were assigned to atorvastatin (10-80 mg/day) based on low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol concentration at screening. For comparison, age and gender-matched blood donors (N=40) were used as controls. Control subjects did not present hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and history of cardiovascular diseases. Adiponectin levels were diminished in patients at high cardiovascular risk compared with control subjects [4166 (3661-4740) vs 5806 (4764-7075) ng/ml respectively; geometric mean (95% CI); P<0.0001]. In the whole population, atorvastatin treatment increased adiponectin levels [9.7 (3.2-16.7);% Change (95% CI); P=0.003]. This increment was in a dose-dependent manner; maximal effect observed with atorvastatin 80 mg/d [24.7 (5.7-47.1); P=0.01]. Adiponectin concentrations were positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol both before and after atorvastatin treatment. No association was observed between adiponectin and LDL-cholesterol before and after atorvastatin treatment. In conclusion, atorvastatin increased adiponectin plasma levels in subjects at high cardiovascular risk, revealing a novel anti-inflammatory effect of this drug.

TI  - Inpatient initiation of beta-blockade plus nurse management in vulnerable heart failure patients: a randomized study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Predischarge beta-blocker initiation in hospitalized patients with heart failure due to reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is safe and improves adherence; improved outcomes with this approach have not been demonstrated in a randomized trial. This study compared 6-month rehospitalization rates among patients assigned to predischarge beta-blockade coupled with postdischarge nurse management (intervention) versus usual care.
AB  - METHODS AND RESULTS: We randomized 64 patients with an LVEF </=0.40 to low-dose carvedilol coupled with nurse management or usual care. The nurse manager saw patients within 2 weeks of discharge, then biweekly until stable. Baseline characteristics reflected a vulnerable population (80% uninsured, 72% minorities, 80% unemployed or disabled), as did heart failure etiology (28% substance abuse, 27% ischemic, 19% hypertension, 17% idiopathic). Mean baseline LVEF was 0.23 in both groups. Among intervention patients at 6 -months, beta-blocker utilization was higher (96 vs. 48%, P < .001), mean New York Heart Association class improved (-1.44 vs. -0.77, P = .01), and total heart failure rehospitalizations were reduced by 84% (3 vs. 19, P = .02). A trend toward improved LVEF was also observed (+16 vs. +11 units, P = .17).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Inpatient beta-blocker initiation coupled with nurse management improved outcomes among sociodemographically disadvantaged heart failure patients. Our results support a practice shift toward inpatient beta-blocker initiation with structured outpatient follow-up.

TI  - Predictive validity of a medication adherence measure in an outpatient setting.
AB  - This study examines the psychometric properties and tests the concurrent and predictive validity of a structured, self-reported medication adherence measure in patients with hypertension. The authors also assessed various psychosocial determinants of adherence, such as knowledge, social support, satisfaction with care, and complexity of the medical regimen. A total of 1367 patients participated in the study; mean age was 52.5 years, 40.8% were male, 76.5% were black, 50.8% graduated from high school, 26% were married, and 54.1% had income <$5,000. The 8-item medication adherence scale was reliable (alpha=.83) and significantly associated with blood pressure control (P<.05). Using a cutpoint of <6, the sensitivity of the measure to identify patients with poor blood pressure control was estimated to be 93%, and the specificity was 53%. The medication adherence measure proved to be reliable, with good concurrent and predictive validity in primarily low-income, minority patients with hypertension and might function as a screening tool in outpatient settings with other patient groups.

TI  - Patients' perceptions of electronic monitoring devices affect medication adherence in hypertensive African Americans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic monitoring devices (EMDs) are regarded as the gold standard for assessing medication adherence in clinical research. However, little is known about the effect of patients' acceptance of EMDs on medication adherence in African Americans with hypertension who are followed in primary care practices
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess patients' perceptions of EMDs, their acceptance of EMDs, and the relationship of these perceptions to medication adherence in African Americans with hypertension who are followed in community-based practices.
AB  - METHODS: Patients were recruited from a larger randomized controlled trial assessing the effect of motivational interviewing on medication adherence and blood pressure in hypertensive African American patients followed in 2 New York City primary care practices. Medication adherence was assessed with a Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) during a 12-month monitoring period. At the 12-month follow-up, patients' perceptions of the MEMS were assessed with a 17-item questionnaire. ANOVA was used to compare patients' responses (agree, neither, disagree) with the MEMS adherence over the monitoring period. Tukey's post hoc tests were used to determine whether there were significant differences among the 3 groups.
AB  - RESULTS: Participants were predominantly women, low-income, unemployed, had a high school education, and were a mean age of 53 years. Approximately two-thirds of the participants stated that the MEMS helped them remember to take their medications, 93% reported that the MEMS was easy to open, 85% did not find it stressful, and 75% liked the MEMS and used it everyday. One-third of patients preferred using a pillbox and 25% did not like traveling with the MEMS. Patients who stated that they used the MEMS every day, felt comfortable using it in front of others, and remembered to put refills in the MEMS had significantly better adherence over the study period than did those who disagreed (p </= 0.05).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: African American patients treated for hypertension in community-based practices held positive perceptions about a MEMS. Perceptions about the practicality of a MEMS may yield important information about actual medication-taking behavior.

TI  - Electronic communications and home blood pressure monitoring (e-BP) study: design, delivery, and evaluation framework.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials have provided unequivocal evidence that treatment of hypertension decreases mortality and major disability from cardiovascular disease; however, blood pressure remains inadequately treated in most affected individuals. This large gap continues despite the facts that more than 90% of adults with hypertension have health insurance, and hypertension is the leading cause of visits to the doctor. New approaches are needed to improve hypertension care.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Electronic Communications and Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (e-BP) study is a three-arm randomized controlled trial designed to determine whether care based on the Chronic Care Model and delivered over the Internet improves hypertension care. The primary study outcomes are systolic, diastolic, and blood pressure control; secondary outcomes are medication adherence, patient self-efficacy, satisfaction and quality of life, and healthcare utilization and costs.
AB  - METHODS: Hypertensive patients receiving care at Group Health medical centers are eligible if they have uncontrolled blood pressure on two screening visits and access to the Web and an e-mail address. Study participants are randomly assigned to three intervention groups: (a) usual care; (b) home blood pressure monitoring receipt and proficiency training on its use and the Group Health secure patient website (with secure e-mail access to their healthcare provider, access to a shared medical record, prescription refill and other services); or (c) this plus pharmacist care management (collaborative care management between the patient, the pharmacist, and the patient's physician via a secure patient website and the electronic medical record).
AB  - CONCLUSION: We will determine whether a new model of patient-centered care that leverages Web communications, self-monitoring, and collaborative care management improves hypertension control. If this model proves successful and cost-effective, similar interventions could be used to improve the care of large numbers of patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

TI  - A cluster randomized trial to evaluate physician/pharmacist collaboration to improve blood pressure control.
AB  - This was a prospective, cluster randomized controlled trial in patients with uncontrolled hypertension aged 21 to 85 years (mean, 61 years). Pharmacists made recommendations to physicians for patients in the intervention clinics (n=101) but not patients in the control clinics (n=78). The mean adjusted difference in systolic blood pressure (BP) between the control and intervention groups was 8.7 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.4-12.9), while the difference in diastolic BP was 5.4 mm Hg (CI, 2.8-8.0) at 9 months. The 24-hour BP levels showed similar effects, with a mean systolic BP level that was 8.8 mm Hg lower (CI, 5.0-12.6) and a mean diastolic BP level that was 4.6 mm Hg (CI, 2.4-6.8) lower in the intervention group. BP was controlled in 89.1% of patients in the intervention group and 52.9% in the control group (adjusted odds ratio, 8.9; CI, 3.8-20.7; P<.001). Physician/pharmacist collaboration achieved significantly better mean BP values and overall BP control rates, primarily by intensification of medication therapy and improving patient adherence.

TI  - Ambulatory blood pressure-lowering effects of valsartan and enalapril after a missed dose in previously untreated patients with hypertension: a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 3 days a month, some 15% to 20% of patients with hypertension do not recall having taken their antihypertensive medication. Individuals with this frequency of missed doses may be at increased risk for a cardiovascular event and may have a poorer long-term prognosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study used ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to compare the blood pressure (BP)-lowering effects of valsartan and enalapril over the 24 hours after missing 1 dose in previously untreated patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, blinded end-point trial in previously untreated patients (age >18 years) with mild to moderate essential hypertension (European Society of Hypertension-European Society of Cardiology guidelines: systolic BP 140-179 mm Hg or diastolic BP 90-109 mm Hg). Patients were randomly assigned to receive 16 weeks of treatment with valsartan 160 mg/d or enalapril 20 mg/d, taken on waking. ABPM was conducted for 48 consecutive hours at baseline and again after 16 weeks of therapy. Patients took a dose of their assigned treatment at the beginning of the final session of ABPM and were instructed to skip the next daily dose.
AB  - RESULTS: The study enrolled 148 Spanish patients (84 men, 64 women; mean [SD] age, 45.8 [10.7] years) with previously untreated hypertension. At the end of treatment, there were significant differences between groups during the first 24 hours of ABPM, starting in the final 6 hours of the dosing interval (P < 0.001). There was no significant change in BP reduction between the first and second 24-hour periods of ABPM with valsartan (-2.1/-1.4 mm Hg), whereas enalapril was associated with a significant increase in BP over this period (5.5/3.8 mm Hg; P < 0.001 vs first 24 hours; P = 0.032 vs valsartan).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In this study in previously untreated patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, valsartan was associated with a sustained BP-lowering effect beyond the initial 24 hours after dosing, whereas enalapril was not. There was no significant change in the efficacy of valsartan in the 24 hours after a missed dose. At the doses tested, valsartan was more effective than enalapril, both during active treatment and after a missed dose.

TI  - Take Control of Your Blood Pressure (TCYB) study: a multifactorial tailored behavioral and educational intervention for achieving blood pressure control.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluating a randomized controlled trial involving a tailored behavioral intervention conducted to improve blood pressure control.
AB  - METHODS: Adults with hypertension from two outpatient primary care clinics were randomly allocated to receive a nurse-administered behavioral intervention or usual care. In this ongoing study, patients receive the tailored behavioral intervention bi-monthly for 2 years via telephone; the goal of the intervention is to promote medication adherence and improve hypertension-related health behaviors. Patient factors targeted in the tailored behavioral intervention include perceived risk of hypertension and knowledge, memory, medical and social support, patients' relationship with their health care provider, adverse effects of medication therapy, weight management, exercise, diet, stress, smoking, and alcohol use.
AB  - RESULTS: The sample randomized to the behavioral intervention consisted of 319 adults with hypertension (average age=60.5 years; 47% African-American). A comparable sample of adults was assigned to usual care (n=317). We had a 96% retention rate for the overall sample for the first 6 months of the study (93% at 12 months). The average phone call has lasted 18min (range 2-51min). From baseline to 6 months, self-reported medication adherence increased by 9% in the behavioral group vs. 1% in the non-behavioral group.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The intervention is easily implemented and is designed to enhance adherence with prescribed hypertension regimen. The study includes both general and patient-tailored information based upon need assessment. The study design ensures internal validity as well as the ability to generalize study findings to the clinic settings.
AB  - PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Despite knowledge of the risks and acceptable evidence, a large number of hypertensive adults still do not have their blood pressure under effective control. This study will be an important step in evaluating a tailored multibehavioral intervention focusing on improving blood pressure control.

TI  - Impact of medication packaging on adherence and treatment outcomes in older ambulatory patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate medication adherence and treatment outcomes in elderly outpatients using daily-dose blister packaging (Pill Calendar) compared with medications packaged in bottles of loose tablets.
AB  - DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.
AB  - SETTING: Ambulatory care clinics at Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus; University of Arizona Health Science Center, Tucson; and Riverside Methodist Hospital Family Medicine Clinic, Columbus, Ohio, from July 1, 2002, to December 31, 2004.
AB  - PATIENTS: 85 individuals 65 years of age or older being treated with lisinopril for hypertension.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive lisinopril in either daily-dose blister packaging (Pill Calendar) or traditional bottles of loose tablets.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adherence was assessed by prescription refill regularity and medication possession ratio (MPR). Treatment outcome and use of medical services were assessed by medical record review of blood pressure and morbidity associated with poorly controlled hypertension.
AB  - RESULTS: Patients receiving lisinopril in the daily-dose blister packaging (Pill Calendar) refilled their prescriptions on time more often (P = 0.01), had higher MPRs (P = 0.04), and had lower diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.01) than patients who had their medications packaged in traditional bottles of loose tablets.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Providing medications in a package that identifies the day each dose is intended to be taken and provides information on proper self-administration can improve treatment regimen adherence and treatment outcomes in elderly patients.

TI  - Community-based weight management in long-term heart transplant recipients: a pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart transplant recipients often suffer from obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension thought to be related to triple-drug immunosuppression and poor adherence to diet and exercise. A lifestyle intervention that allows recipients to attend a community-based weight management program may improve health outcomes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine (1) the effects of attending a community-based weight management program on weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and the lipid profile; and (2) the feasibility of a community-based program for weight management.
AB  - METHODS: Twenty-one patients (81% male; age 57 years, 99.7 months since transplantation) participated in a randomized clinical trial and received either weight management counseling (control) or a 6-month scholarship to a structured commercial program (treatment). Using simple analysis of covariance models, group differences were assessed and reported as marginal means.
AB  - RESULTS: At baseline, there were no demographic differences between groups. There were no differences in outcome variables except weight (control, 102.1 kg vs treatment, 98.3 kg; P= .05). After 6 months, significant differences were found in weight (control, 100.5 kg vs treatment, 95.6 kg; P= .047) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (control, 40.6 mg/dL vs treatment, 49.1 mg/dL; P= .044). A marginally significant difference was found in systolic blood pressure (control, 138 mm Hg vs treatment, 121 mm Hg; P= .07). A decrease in diastolic blood pressure (6 mm Hg) was attributed to treatment effect (P = .16). No differences were noted in total cholesterol, triglycerides, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The structured commercial program appears to be an effective, feasible alternative to usual care. Findings need to be confirmed in future research with a larger sample.

TI  - Effect of general practitioner education on adherence to antihypertensive drugs: cluster randomised controlled trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of a simple educational package for general practitioners on adherence to antihypertensive drugs.
AB  - DESIGN: Cluster randomised controlled trial.
AB  - SETTING: Six randomly selected communities in Karachi, Pakistan.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: 200 patients with hypertension taking antihypertensive drugs; 78 general practitioners.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Care by general practitioners specially trained in management of hypertension compared with usual care.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Correct dosing, defined as percentage of prescribed doses taken, measured with electronic medication event monitoring system (MEMS) bottle.
AB  - RESULTS: 200 patients were enrolled, and 178 (89%) successfully completed six weeks of follow-up. Adherence was significantly greater in the special care group than in the usual care group (unadjusted mean percentage days with correct dose 48.1%, 95% confidence interval 35.8% to 60.4%, versus 32.4%, 22.6% to 42.3%; P=0.048). Adherence was also higher among patients who had higher levels of education (P<0.001), were encouraged by family members (P<0.001), believed in the effect of drugs (P<0.001), and had the purpose of the drugs explained to them (P<0.001).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Special training of general practitioners in management of hypertension, emphasising good communication between doctors and patients, is more effective than usual care provided in the communities in Karachi. Such simple interventions should be adopted by other developing countries that are now facing an increasing burden of hypertension.

TI  - Clinical evaluation of IDAS II, a new electronic device enabling drug adherence monitoring.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to evaluate clinically the acceptability of the IDAS II (Intelligent Drug Administration System), a new electronic device that enables drug adherence monitoring.
AB  - METHODS: IDAS II was compared to another electronic monitor, the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) in a randomised two-way cross-over study involving 24 hypertensive patients treated with irbesartan. Patients used each device for 2 months. The main parameter of evaluation was the patients' opinion on both devices. Rates of adherence and blood pressure were also assessed.
AB  - RESULTS: Most patients considered both devices to be reliable reminders (IDAS II: 75%;MEMS: 84%, p = ns). Ten patients (42%) preferred the MEMS, while 11 (46%) preferred the IDAS II; three (12%) expressed no preference. Patients found the MEMS device easier to use than the IDAS device (p < 0.001) but appreciated the IDAS blister packs better than the MEMS bulk packaging (p < 0.01). Over the 4-month period, the median "taking adherence" was excellent (99.2%) and comparable with both devices. However, the regularity of drug intake timing was higher with the IDAS II (p < 0.01).
AB  - CONCLUSION: IDAS II, a new electronic device enabling drug adherence monitoring without reconditioning of the drugs appears to be a well-accepted device. Overall, practicability and acceptability of the IDAS II and the MEMS device were similar. Thus, IDAS II could be a useful tool for the management of long-term therapies.

TI  - Randomized controlled trials of positive affect and self-affirmation to facilitate healthy behaviors in patients with cardiopulmonary diseases: rationale, trial design, and methods.
AB  - Secondary prevention of adverse outcomes in patients with cardiopulmonary disease requires that patients become actively engaged in self-management efforts such as participation in physical activity or medication adherence. However, despite assiduous efforts to find strategies that help cardiovascular patients to adopt and maintain such behaviors, many studies of interventions designed to improve physical activity and adherence to medication have shown disappointing results. To this end, the Translational Behavioral Science Research Consortium was created by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to identify promising, but underutilized findings from basic behavioral science that might have potential application for translation to clinical populations where behavioral change has been refractory to standard intervention approaches. This paper describes the rationale and methods of a novel research project designed to test the efficacy of a behavioral intervention that combines constructs from two behavioral science theories (positive affect and self-affirmation) in order to help patients with coronary artery disease, asthma, and hypertension successfully change behaviors. The project consists of an intervention framed upon positive affect and self-affirmation and tested in three concurrent randomized controlled trials among three distinct populations. Each trial had a qualitative phase that served as a formative stage to inform the intervention; a pilot phase during which the feasibility of the intervention was tested and refined; and a randomized controlled phase conducted to investigate the effects of the interventions in these three patient groups.

TI  - A nurse-led cardiac rehabilitation programme improves health behaviours and cardiac physiological risk parameters: evidence from Chengdu, China.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of a cardiac rehabilitation programme on health behaviours and physiological risk parameters in patients with coronary heart disease in Chengdu, China.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies indicate a dose-, level- and duration-dependent relationship exists between cardiac behavioural and physiological risks and coronary heart disease incidence as well as subsequent cardiac morbidity and mortality. Cardiac risk factor modification has become the very primary goal of modern cardiac rehabilitation programmes.
AB  - DESIGN METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted. Coronary heart disease patients (n = 167) who met the sampling criteria in two tertiary medical centres in Chengdu, south-west China, were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (the cardiac rehabilitation programme) or control group (the routine care). The change of health behaviours (walking performance, step II diet adherence, medication adherence, smoking cessation) and physiological risk parameters (serum lipids, blood pressure, body weight) were assessed to evaluate the programme effect.
AB  - RESULTS: Patients in the intervention group demonstrated a significantly better performance in walking, step II diet adherence, medication adherence; a significantly greater reduction in serum lipids including triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein; and significantly better control of systolic and diastolic blood pressure at three months. The majority of these positive impacts were maintained at six months. The effect of the programme on smoking cessation, body weight, serum high-density lipoprotein, was not confirmed.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A cardiac rehabilitation programme led by a nurse can significantly improve the health behaviours and cardiac physiological risk parameters in coronary heart disease patients. Nurses can fill significant treatment gaps in the risk factor management of patients with coronary heart disease.
AB  - RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study raises attention regarding the important roles nurses can play in cardiac rehabilitation and the unique way for nurses to meet the rehabilitative care needs of coronary heart disease patients. Furthermore, the hospital-home bridging nature of the programme also created a model for interfacing the acute care and community rehabilitative care.

TI  - The PREMIER intervention helps participants follow the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension dietary pattern and the current Dietary Reference Intakes recommendations.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of the PREMIER study lifestyle interventions on dietary intakes and adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern and the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI).
AB  - DESIGN: An 18-month multicenter, randomized controlled trial comparing two multicomponent lifestyle intervention programs to an advice only control group.
AB  - SUBJECTS/SETTING: A total of 810 participants were recruited from local communities and randomized into the study. Individuals were eligible if they were aged 25 years or older, had body mass index between 18.5 and 45.0, not taking antihypertensive medication, and had prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension (systolic blood pressure 120 to 159 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure 80 to 95 mm Hg).
AB  - INTERVENTION: The two active intervention programs were a behavioral lifestyle intervention that implements established recommendations, and an established intervention plus the DASH dietary pattern. Both interventions consisted of intensive group and individual counseling sessions. The control group received a brief advice session after randomization and again after 6 months of data collection. Dietary intakes were collected by two random 24-hour recalls at baseline, 6 months, and 18 months.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome of the PREMIER study was change in systolic blood pressure at 6 months. The main outcomes examined here include dietary variables collected by 24-hour recall at each time point.
AB  - STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Nutrient intakes were calculated and compared among the time points and the three intervention groups using mixed models with repeated measures at 6 and 18 months. Proportion of participants who met or achieved the original DASH nutrient intake levels and the DRIs were calculated and compared among the three intervention groups. P<0.01 was considered statistically significant.
AB  - RESULTS: Participants in both the established intervention and established intervention plus DASH dietary pattern groups substantially reduced energy, total fat, saturated fat, and sodium intake and these reductions persisted throughout the study. Established intervention plus DASH dietary pattern group participants increased intakes of fruits, vegetables, dairy, and many vitamins and minerals; these increases were significantly greater than that of the control and established intervention groups. A majority of established intervention plus DASH dietary pattern group participants achieved at least two thirds of the DRI recommendations for most nutrients at 6 months, despite their reduction in total energy intake. Some but relatively small recidivism occurred at 18 months.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Both the established intervention and established intervention plus DASH dietary pattern group intervention were effective in helping participants follow established recommendations to control blood pressure. The advice-only control group also made some behavior changes, mainly decreasing energy and sodium intake. Only the established intervention plus DASH dietary pattern group significantly increased intakes of DASH-specific food groups, including fruits, vegetables, and dairy products, and nutrients, including protein, fiber, calcium, potassium, and magnesium. Most of the increases did not reach the levels consumed in the original DASH feeding studies. Whereas the established intervention plus DASH dietary pattern group intervention provides a useful platform to achieve the DASH dietary pattern and current DRI recommendations, intervention enhancements, including a greater emphasis on nutrient-dense foods, would likely improve this intervention.

TI  - Effects of individual components of multiple behavior changes: the PREMIER trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess contributions of individual lifestyle changes on systolic blood pressure (SBP) changes.
AB  - METHODS: We examined associations between lifestyle behavior changes and SBP after 6 and 18 months in 782 PREMIER trial participants.
AB  - RESULTS: In multivariate models omitting weight, predicted SBP reductions ranged from (1)/2 to 1(1)/2 mm Hg for reduced urinary sodium, improved fitness, and adherence to the DASH diet (except sodium at 18 months). With weight included, only fitness change additionally predicted SBP at 18 months.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Several lifestyle behavior changes are important for BP lowering, but are difficult to detect when weight is included in multivariate models.

TI  - Hypertension Intervention Nurse Telemedicine Study (HINTS): testing a multifactorial tailored behavioral/educational and a medication management intervention for blood pressure control.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Only 31% of Americans with hypertension have their blood pressure (BP) under effective control. We describe a study that tests 3 different interventions in a randomized controlled trial using home BP telemedicine monitoring.
AB  - METHODS: A sample of hypertensive patients with poor BP control at baseline (N = 600) are randomized to 1 of 4 arms: (1) control group--a group of hypertensive patients who receive usual care; (2) nurse-administered tailored behavioral intervention; (3) nurse-administered medication management according to a hypertension decision support system; (4) combination of the 2 interventions. The interventions are triggered based on home BP values transmitted via telemonitoring devices over standard telephone lines. The tailored behavioral intervention involves promoting adherence with medication and health behaviors. Patients randomized to the medication management or the combined arm have their hypertension regimen changed by the study team using a validated hypertension decision support system based on evidence-based hypertension treatment guidelines and individualized to patients' comorbid illnesses. The primary outcome is BP control: < or = 140/90 mm Hg (nondiabetic) and < or = 130/80 mm Hg (diabetics) measured at 6-month intervals over 18 months (4 total measurements).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Given the increasing prevalence of hypertension and our inability to achieve adequate BP control using traditional models of care, testing novel interventions in patients' homes may improve access, quality, and outcomes.

TI  - The medication Adherence and Blood Pressure Control (ABC) trial: a multi-site randomized controlled trial in a hypertensive, multi-cultural, economically disadvantaged population.
AB  - The Medication Adherence and BP Control Trial (ABC Trial) is a randomized, controlled, multi-site, medication adherence and blood pressure (BP) control trial in an economically disadvantaged and multi-cultural population of hypertensive patients followed in primary care practices. To date, no other such trial has been published in which objective measures of adherence (electronic pill bottles) were used to assess the effectiveness of these behavioral interventions for hypertension. This study tested a combination of commercially-available interventions that can be easily accessed by health care providers and patients, and therefore may provide a real-world solution to the problem of non-adherence among hypertensives. The aim of the ABC Trial was to test the effectiveness of a stepped care intervention in improving both medication adherence to an antihypertensive medication regimen and BP control. Step 1 of the intervention employed home Self-BP Monitoring (SBPM); at this stage, there were two arms: (1) Usual Care (UC) and (2) Intervention. At Step 2, patients in the intervention arm whose BP had not come under control after 3 months were further randomized to one of two conditions: (1) continuation of SBPM (alone) or (2) continuation of SBPM plus telephone-based nurse case management (SBPM+NCM). Electronic Medication Event Monitoring (MEMS) was the primary measure of medication adherence, and in-office BP was the primary measure of hypertension control. We present an overview of the study design, details of the administrative structure of the study and a description of clinical site recruitment, patient recruitment, and follow-up assessments.

TI  - Clinical inertia: a common barrier to changing provider prescribing behavior.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A cross-sectional content analysis nested within a randomized, controlled trial was conducted to collect information on provider responses to computer alerts regarding guideline recommendations for patients with suboptimal hypertension care.
AB  - METHODS: Participants were providers who cared for 1,017 patients with uncontrolled hypertension on a single antihypertensive agent within Veterans Affairs primary care clinics. All reasons for action or inaction were sorted into a framework to explain the variation in guideline adaptation.
AB  - RESULTS: The 184 negative provider responses to computer alerts contained explanations for not changing patient treatment; 76 responses to the alerts were positive, that is, the provider was going to make a change in antihypertensive regimen. The negative responses were categorized as: inertia of practice (66%), lack of agreement with specific guidelines (5%), patient-based factors (17%), environmental factors (10%), and lack of knowledge (2%). Most of the 135 providers classified as inertia of practice indicated, "Continue current medications and I will discuss at the next visit." The median number of days until the next visit was 45 days (interquartile range, 29 to 78 days).
AB  - DISCUSSION: Clinical inertia was the primary reason for failing to engage in otherwise indicated treatment change in a subgroup of patients. A framework was provided as a taxonomy for classification of provider barriers.

TI  - Prevalence and predictors of poor antihypertensive medication adherence in an urban health clinic setting.
AB  - Poor medication adherence may contribute to low hypertension control rates. In 2005, 295 hypertensive patients who reported taking antihypertensive medication were administered a telephone questionnaire including an 8-item scale assessing medication adherence. Overall, 35.6%, 36.0%, and 28.4% of patients were determined to have good, medium, and poor medication adherence, respectively. After multivariable adjustment, adults younger than 50 years and 51 to 60 years were 1.39 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-3.42) and 1.53 (95% CI, 0.64-3.66), respectively, times more likely to be less adherent when compared with their counterparts who were older than 60 years. Black adults and men were 4.30 (95% CI, 1.06-17.5) and 2.45 (95% CI, 1.04-5.78) times more likely to be less adherent, respectively. Additionally, caring for dependents, an initial diagnosis of hypertension within 10 years, being uncomfortable about asking the doctor questions, and wanting to spend more time with the doctor if possible were associated with poor medication adherence. The current study identified a set of risk factors for poor antihypertensive medication adherence in the urban setting.

TI  - Cost effectiveness of an adherence-improving programme in hypertensive patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-adherence to antihypertensive drugs is high, and the economic consequences of non-adherence may be substantial. The Medication Events Monitoring System (MEMS), which is a method to improve adherence, has been shown to be a useful tool for the management of adherence problems.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of the MEMS compared with usual care in a population of hypertensive patients with poor adherence. The MEMS programme consisted of provision of containers fitted with electronic caps together with adherence training if indicated.
AB  - METHODS: In a randomised controlled trial, 164 hypertensive patients in the experimental strategy and 89 patients in the usual care strategy were followed for 5 months. Patients who had a systolic blood pressure (SBP) > or = 160 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) > or = 95 mm Hg despite the use of antihypertensive drugs were eligible. Patients were recruited by a GP, and treatment took place in general practice. In the experimental strategy, electronic monitoring of the intake of antihypertensive drugs was introduced without change of medication. Unsatisfactory adherence was defined as < 85% of days with the number of doses taken as prescribed. In the usual care strategy, antihypertensive treatment was intensified by the addition or change of antihypertensive drugs, if necessary, without provision of an electronic monitor. Outcome parameters included the proportion of patients with normalised blood pressure (NBP) at 5 months and QALYs. Costs were quantified from the healthcare and societal perspective. Non-parametric bootstrap simulations were performed to quantify the uncertainty around the mean estimates and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were presented. In addition, a number of univariate sensitivity analyses were performed on deterministic variables.
AB  - RESULTS: At 5 months, 3.1% (95% UI [uncertainty interval] -9.7%, +15.8%) more patients had NBP, and 0.003 (95% UI -0.005, +0.010) more QALYs were generated in the experimental strategy. A statistically significant lower percentage of patients had a dose escalation in the experimental strategy. Irrespective of the ceiling ratio for cost effectiveness, the cost-effectiveness probability was between 75% and 80% for the analysis from the healthcare perspective using proportion of patients with NBP as the outcome parameter. For the analysis from the societal perspective using QALYs as the outcome parameter, this probability was between 45% and 51%.
AB  - CONCLUSION: For a time horizon of 5 months, a difference in both cost and effect could not be detected between an adherence-improving programme compared with usual care for hypertensive patients. The probability that the adherence-improving programme is cost effective is at best moderate. Moreover, the cost-effectiveness result is surrounded with considerable uncertainty and large-scale implementation warrants additional research into the economic consequences of this intervention. Patients may benefit from the use of a MEMS monitor in situations where BP targets are not reached because of suspected non-adherence and both patient and GP are reluctant to increase the dose or number of antihypertensive drugs.

TI  - Blood pressure responses to lifestyle physical activity among young, hypertension-prone African-American women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity and obesity increase the risk for hypertension, and both are more prevalent in African-American than Caucasian women. Regular physical activity serves as an important intervention for reducing cardiovascular risk, yet the ideal physical activity profile to meet the needs of young, sedentary African-American women remains unclear. We performed a randomized, parallel, single-blind study to examine the effect of lifestyle physical activity (LPA) on blood pressure indices in sedentary African-American women aged 18 to 45 years with prehypertension or untreated stage 1 hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: The primary intervention was an 8-week individualized, home-based program in which women randomized to Exercise (n = 14) were instructed to engage in lifestyle-compatible physical activity (eg, walking, stair climbing) for 10 minutes, 3 times a day, 5 days a week, at a prescribed heart rate corresponding to an intensity of 50% to 60% heart rate reserve. Women in the No Exercise group (n = 10) continued with their usual daily activities. Mean changes in cuff, ambulatory, and pressure load indices were compared using paired t tests, and physical activity adherence was expressed as percentages.
AB  - RESULTS: Women in the Exercise group had a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (-6.4 mm Hg, P = .036), a decrease in diastolic blood pressure status to the prehypertensive level (90.8 vs 87.4 mm Hg), and greater reductions in nighttime pressure load compared with the No Exercise group. Adherence to LPA was exceedingly high by all measures (65%-98%) and correlated with change in systolic blood pressure (r = -0.620, P = .024).
AB  - CONCLUSION: The accumulation of LPA reduced cuff, ambulatory, and pressure load. The accumulation of LPA appears well tolerated and feasible in this sample of young African-American women, demonstrated by the overall high adherence rates. Given the excess burden of pressure-related clinical sequelae among African Americans and the strong correlation between pressure load and target organ damage, LPA may represent a practical and effective strategy in this population.

TI  - Electronic monitoring of adherence as a tool to improve blood pressure control. A randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor adherence to antihypertensive drug regimens is believed to be a major contributor to treatment failure. Electronic monitoring of adherence may improve adherence and allow differentiation between those who are nonadherent and those who are pharmacologically nonresponsive. This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of electronic monitoring of adherence in lowering blood pressure (BP) in comparison with usual care.
AB  - METHODS: A total of 258 patients with high BP despite use of antihypertensive medication were randomly assigned to either continuation of usual care (with adjustment in antihypertensive medication if necessary) or to the introduction of electronic monitoring. Adherence to antihypertensive medication was monitored for 2 months without medication changes. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients who reached target BP levels after a 5-month follow-up period.
AB  - RESULTS: At 5 months, 50.6% of the patients in the usual care group reached adequate BP, v 53.7% in the electronic monitoring group (P = .73). The percentages of patients with drug additions or increases in dosage were higher in the usual care group compared with those in whom adherence was monitored (P < .01).
AB  - CONCLUSION: These data show that electronic monitoring in comparison to usual care results in similar BP control but leads to fewer drug changes and less drug use. This result is likely to be achieved by improving adherence. Hence a strategy that includes electronic monitoring has the potential to prevent unnecessary treatment escalation in patients with poor adherence.

TI  - An RCT of the effect of motivational interviewing on medication adherence in hypertensive African Americans: rationale and design.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension disproportionately affects African Americans compared to whites, and it is the single most common explanation for the disparity in mortality between African Americans and whites. Adherence with antihypertensive medications can help reduce risk of negative hypertension-related outcomes. Motivational interviewing is a promising patient-centered approach for improving adherence in patients with chronic diseases. In this paper we describe the rationale and design of an ongoing randomized controlled trial testing the effectiveness of motivational interviewing versus usual care in improving medication adherence among 190 African American uncontrolled hypertensive patients, who receive care in a primary care setting.
AB  - METHODS: The usual care group receives standard medical care, while those in the intervention group receive standard care plus four sessions of motivational interviewing at 3-month intervals for a period of 1 year. This technique consists of brief, patient-driven counseling sessions to facilitate initiation and maintenance of behavior change. The primary outcome is adherence to prescribed antihypertensive medication, assessed with the electronic medication events monitoring system (MEMS) and the Morisky self-report adherence questionnaire. Secondary outcomes are within-patient changes in blood pressure, self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation between baseline and 12 months. We report the baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the participants.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Despite the potential utility of motivational interviewing, little is known about its effectiveness in improving medication adherence among hypertensive patients, especially African Americans. In addition to the baseline data this study has generated, this trial should provide data with which we can assess the effectiveness of this approach as a behavioral intervention.

TI  - The Take Control of Your Blood pressure (TCYB) study: study design and methodology.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Among the 65 million Americans with hypertension, only approximately 31% have their blood pressure under control (<140/90 mm/Hg). Despite the damaging impact of hypertension and the availability of evidence-based target values for blood pressure, interventions to improve blood pressure control have had limited success.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A randomized controlled health services intervention trial with a two by two design is being conducted to improve blood pressure control. This five-year trial evaluates two patient-directed interventions designed to improve blood pressure control among patients diagnosed with hypertension in a community-based primary care setting.
AB  - METHODS: Patients are randomized to one of four groups: usual care, home blood pressure monitoring, tailored behavioral self-management intervention that is administered via telephone by a nurse, or a combination of the home blood pressure monitoring and tailored behavioral intervention. Patients receiving the home blood pressure monitoring are trained in the use of an electronic blood pressure measurement device, are asked to measure their blood pressure 3 times/week, and send in two-month blood pressure recordings throughout the 24-month study duration. The behavioral intervention incorporates patients' need assessments and involves tailored behavioral and education modules to promote medication adherence and improve specific health behaviors. A nurse delivers all behavioral self-management modules over the telephone bi-monthly for 24 months. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients who achieve control of their blood pressure based on evidence-based guidelines (for patients without diabetes <140/90 mm/Hg, for patients with diabetes <130/80 mm/Hg) evaluated at six-month intervals over 24 months (five measurements) using a random-zero sphygmomanometer.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Despite the known risk of poor blood pressure control, and the wide availability of effective treatment strategies, a majority of adults still do not have their blood pressure controlled. This study will be an important step in defining two explicit interventions to improve blood pressure control. To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine both a tailored behavioral self-management intervention and self-monitoring home blood pressure intervention to improve blood pressure control among patients in a primary care setting.

TI  - Identifying barriers to hypertension guideline adherence using clinician feedback at the point of care.
AB  - Factors contributing to low adherence to clinical guidelines by clinicians are not well understood. The user interface of ATHENA-HTN, a guideline-based decision support system (DSS) for hypertension, presents a novel opportunity to collect clinician feedback on recommendations displayed at the point of care. We analyzed feedback from 46 clinicians who received ATHENA advisories as part of a 15-month randomized trial to identify potential reasons clinicians may not intensify hypertension therapy when it is recommended. Among the 368 visits for which feedback was provided, clinicians commonly reported they did not follow recommendations because: recorded blood pressure was not representative of the patient's typical blood pressure; hypertension was not a clinical priority for the visit; or patients were nonadherent to medications. For many visits, current quality-assurance algorithms may incorrectly identify clinically appropriate decisions as guideline nonadherent due to incomplete capture of relevant information. We present recommendations for how automated DSSs may help identify "apparent" barriers and better target decision support.

TI  - Effect of a pharmacy care program on medication adherence and persistence, blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - CONTEXT: Poor medication adherence diminishes the health benefits of pharmacotherapies. Elderly patients with coronary risk factors frequently require treatment with multiple medications, placing them at increased risk for nonadherence.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of a comprehensive pharmacy care program to improve medication adherence and its associated effects on blood pressure (BP) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).
AB  - DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A multiphase, prospective study with an observational phase and a randomized controlled trial conducted at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center of 200 community-based patients aged 65 years or older taking at least 4 chronic medications. The study was conducted from June 2004 to August 2006.
AB  - INTERVENTION: After a 2-month run-in phase (measurement of baseline adherence, BP, and LDL-C), patients entered a 6-month intervention phase (standardized medication education, regular follow-up by pharmacists, and medications dispensed in time-specific packs). Following the intervention phase, patients were randomized to continued pharmacy care vs usual care for an additional 6 months.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary end point of the observation phase was change in the proportion of pills taken vs baseline; secondary end points were the associated changes in BP and LDL-C. Primary end point of the randomization phase was the between-group comparison of medication persistence.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 200 elderly patients (77.1% men; mean [SD] age, 78 [8.3] years), taking a mean (SD) of 9 (3) chronic medications were enrolled. Coronary risk factors included drug-treated hypertension in 184 patients (91.5%) and drug-treated hyperlipidemia in 162 (80.6%). Mean (SD) baseline medication adherence was 61.2% (13.5%). After 6 months of intervention, medication adherence increased to 96.9% (5.2%; P<.001) and was associated with significant improvements in systolic BP (133.2 [14.9] to 129.9 [16.0] mm Hg; P = .02) and LDL-C (91.7 [26.1] to 86.8 [23.4] mg/dL; P = .001). Six months after randomization, the persistence of medication adherence decreased to 69.1% (16.4%) among those patients assigned to usual care, whereas it was sustained at 95.5% (7.7%) in pharmacy care (P<.001). This was associated with significant reductions in systolic BP in the pharmacy care group (-6.9 mm Hg; 95% CI, -10.7 to -3.1 mm Hg) vs the usual care group (-1.0 mm Hg; 95% CI, -5.9 to 3.9 mm Hg; P = .04), but no significant between-group differences in LDL-C levels or reductions.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A pharmacy care program led to increases in medication adherence, medication persistence, and clinically meaningful reductions in BP, whereas discontinuation of the program was associated with decreased medication adherence and persistence.

TI  - Impact on hypertension control of a patient-held guideline: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is generally poorly controlled in primary care. One possible intervention for improving control is the harnessing of patient expertise through education and encouragement to challenge their care.
AB  - AIM: To determine whether encouraging patients to manage their hypertension in an 'expert' manner, by providing them with information in a clear clinical guideline, coupled with an explicit exhortation to become involved in and to challenge their own care if appropriate, would improve their care.
AB  - DESIGN OF STUDY: Single blind randomised controlled trial of detailed guideline versus standard information.
AB  - SETTING: Single urban general practice over 1 year.
AB  - METHOD: Patient-held guideline with written explicit exhortation to challenge care when appropriate. Two hundred and ninety-four of 536 eligible patients on the practice hypertension register were recruited, all of whom were randomised into one of two groups. Two hundred and thirty-six patients completed the study.
AB  - RESULTS:
AB  - PRIMARY OUTCOME: average systolic blood pressure.
AB  - SECONDARY OUTCOMES: proportion of patients with blood pressure < 150 mmHg systolic and < 90 mmHg diastolic, average cholesterol, proportion of patients prescribed statins and aspirin according to guideline, hospital anxiety and depression score. No clinically, or statistically significant differences were found between intervention and control with respect to all parameters or in anxiety and depression levels. Statin and aspirin use improved throughout the course of the study in both groups. Statin use showed a trend (P = 0.02) in favour of control.
AB  - CONCLUSION: In this study there was no clinically significant perceived benefit to patients as a result of providing them with a hypertension guideline. Patient guidelines are currently planned for many chronic illnesses. It is important to determine the utility of such interventions before scarce resources are applied to them.

TI  - An educational programme for peer review groups to improve treatment of chronic heart failure and diabetes mellitus type 2 in general practice.
AB  - RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Peer review groups are considered helpful for quality improvement in primary care. An interactive educational programme for small peer groups was developed, focusing on the implementation of newly developed treatment guidelines. The aim is to evaluate the effect of the programme on adherence to treatment guidelines in general practice.
AB  - METHODS: A cluster randomized trial using a balanced incomplete block design was used; one arm received a programme on treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF), the other on hypertension treatment in diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM). A random sample of 10 CHF and 10 T2DM patients per GP was drawn, for whom data were extracted from electronic patient records 1 years before and 6 months after the intervention. The outcomes were prescribing of ACE inhibitors, and antihypertensive treatment in T2DM. The effect was analysed separately for both programmes using multilevel regression models.
AB  - RESULTS: All 27 peer review groups in one region in the Netherlands were randomized, of which 16 participated. No significant effects were observed in the CHF group or in the T2DM group. The opportunity for change was limited, as only 53% of the CHF patients and 60% of the T2DM patients had a contact with their GP between the intervention and follow-up measurement.
AB  - CONCLUSION: The peer review programme was not successful for changing the treatment of chronic patients, although the programme focused on dealing with barriers perceived by the participants. Not all problems perceived can be solved in a peer group discussion.

TI  - Rational prescribing in primary care (RaPP): a cluster randomized trial of a tailored intervention.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A gap exists between evidence and practice regarding the management of cardiovascular risk factors. This gap could be narrowed if systematically developed clinical practice guidelines were effectively implemented in clinical practice. We evaluated the effects of a tailored intervention to support the implementation of systematically developed guidelines for the use of antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering drugs for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.
AB  - METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a cluster-randomized trial comparing a tailored intervention to passive dissemination of guidelines in 146 general practices in two geographical areas in Norway. Each practice was randomized to either the tailored intervention (70 practices; 257 physicians) or control group (69 practices; 244 physicians). Patients started on medication for hypertension or hypercholesterolemia during the study period and all patients already on treatment that consulted their physician during the trial were included. A multifaceted intervention was tailored to address identified barriers to change. Key components were an educational outreach visit with audit and feedback, and computerized reminders linked to the medical record system. Pharmacists conducted the visits. Outcomes were measured for all eligible patients seen in the participating practices during 1 y before and after the intervention. The main outcomes were the proportions of (1) first-time prescriptions for hypertension where thiazides were prescribed, (2) patients assessed for cardiovascular risk before prescribing antihypertensive or cholesterol-lowering drugs, and (3) patients treated for hypertension or hypercholesterolemia for 3 mo or more who had achieved recommended treatment goals. The intervention led to an increase in adherence to guideline recommendations on choice of antihypertensive drug. Thiazides were prescribed to 17% of patients in the intervention group versus 11% in the control group (relative risk 1.94; 95% confidence interval 1.49-2.49, adjusted for baseline differences and clustering effect). Little or no differences were found for risk assessment prior to prescribing and for achievement of treatment goals.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Our tailored intervention had a significant impact on prescribing of antihypertensive drugs, but was ineffective in improving the quality of other aspects of managing hypertension and hypercholesterolemia in primary care.

TI  - Impact of baseline echocardiography on treatment outcome in primary care patients with newly detected arterial hypertension: a randomized trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to test whether baseline echocardiography in newly detected hypertension improves left ventricular mass index and blood pressure control. This is a randomized trial with primary care patients.
AB  - METHODS: After routine clinical work-up 177 consecutive patients with newly detected hypertension were randomized according to result of their echocardiogram (echo group and control group). Treating physicians were encouraged to prescribe angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy for patients with evidence of hypertensive target organ damage. Mean blood pressure (BP) and echocardiographic left ventricular mass index were measured at baseline and after 6 months of therapy in both groups.
AB  - RESULTS: More patients with hypertensive target organ damage were identified in the echo group as compared to the control group (58 of 91 [64%] v 42 of 86 [49%] patients (difference 15%, 95% CI 1%-29%). In the echo group, 41 patients (45%) received angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy as compared to 27 patients (31%) in the control group (difference 14%, 95% CI 0-28%). After 6 months, there were no differences in mean left ventricular mass index, mean diastolic 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, or mean systolic and diastolic office BP between the two groups.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: In patients with newly detected hypertension, baseline echocardiography detects more patients with hypertensive target organ damage, but does not lead to a reduction in left ventricular mass index or improved BP control after 6 months of therapy.

TI  - Stop Hypertension with the Acupuncture Research Program (SHARP): results of a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  - Case studies and small trials suggest that acupuncture may effectively treat hypertension, but no large randomized trials have been reported. The Stop Hypertension with the Acupuncture Research Program pilot trial enrolled 192 participants with untreated blood pressure (BP) in the range of 140/90 to 179/109 mm Hg. The design of the trial combined rigorous methodology and adherence to principles of traditional Chinese medicine. Participants were weaned off antihypertensives before enrollment and were then randomly assigned to 3 treatments: individualized traditional Chinese acupuncture, standardized acupuncture at preselected points, or invasive sham acupuncture. Participants received < or = 12 acupuncture treatments over 6 to 8 weeks. During the first 10 weeks after random assignment, BP was monitored every 14 days, and antihypertensives were prescribed if BP exceeded 180/110 mm Hg. The mean BP decrease from baseline to 10 weeks, the primary end point, did not differ significantly between participants randomly assigned to active (individualized and standardized) versus sham acupuncture (systolic BP: -3.56 versus -3.84 mm Hg, respectively; 95% CI for the difference: -4.0 to 4.6 mm Hg; P=0.90; diastolic BP: -4.32 versus -2.81 mm Hg, 95% CI for the difference: -3.6 to 0.6 mm Hg; P=0.16). Categorizing participants by age, race, gender, baseline BP, history of antihypertensive use, obesity, or primary traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis did not reveal any subgroups for which the benefits of active acupuncture differed significantly from sham acupuncture. Active acupuncture provided no greater benefit than invasive sham acupuncture in reducing systolic or diastolic BP.

TI  - Efficacy of a transtheoretical model-based expert system for antihypertensive adherence.
AB  - Blood pressure is not controlled in as many as 50%-75% of hypertensive patients, primarily because of inadequate adherence to treatment. This paper examines the efficacy of a Transtheoretical Model (TTM)-based expert system intervention designed to improve adherence with antihypertensives in a sample of 1,227 adults. Participants were proactively recruited and randomly assigned to receive usual care or three individualized expert system reports and a stage-matched manual over 6 months. Participants were surveyed at baseline, and 6, 12, and 18 months. Significantly more of the intervention group participants reported being in Action and Maintenance at follow-up time points (ie, 73.1% of the treatment group versus 57.6% of the control group at 12 months and 69.1% of the treatment group versus 59.2% of the control group at 18 months). Scores on a behavioral measure of nonadherence differed significantly at follow-up time points. TTM-based expert system interventions have the potential for a significant impact on entire populations of individuals who fail to adhere, regardless of their readiness to change.

TI  - Hypothermia pediatric head injury trial: the value of a pretrial clinical evaluation phase.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The utility of a pretrial clinical evaluation or run-in phase prior to conducting trials of complex interventions such as hypothermia therapy following severe traumatic brain injury in children and adolescents has not been established.
AB  - METHODS: The primary objective of this study was to prospectively evaluate the ability of investigators to adhere to the clinical protocols of care including the cooling and rewarming procedures as well as management guidelines in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale<or=8) treated with 24 h of hypothermia therapy. A secondary objective was to evaluate the ability of study research assistants to complete the study case report form using a procedures manual. The study was conducted at 18 sites in Canada, the United Kingdom and France prior to proceeding to a randomized controlled trial (RCT). After 2 patients were enrolled at each center, an independent clinical evaluation committee examined the process of care and the completeness of data collection. Centers were permitted to enroll patients in the RCT once they met pre-established adherence criteria.
AB  - RESULTS: Seventeen of the 18 centers completed the pretrial clinical evaluation phase demonstrating compliance with study procedures and proceeded to an RCT of hypothermia therapy. One center enrolled only 1 patient in the pretrial clinical evaluation phase due to small numbers of patients with traumatic brain injury, and therefore, did not proceed to the RCT. Three centers were required to enroll more than 2 patients in the pretrial clinical evaluation phase prior to proceeding to the RCT because of problems with adherence to the clinical protocols at two centers and the training of new study personnel at another center. Of the 39 patients enrolled during the pretrial clinical evaluation phase, 8 (20.5%) died and 22 (62.9%) had a good outcome defined as normal, mild or moderate disability assessed using the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score at 6 months following injury.
AB  - DISCUSSION: The pretrial clinical evaluation phase was useful to ensure compliance with complex hypothermia therapy and consensus-based clinical management guidelines of care successfully implemented across 17 of 18 centers. This study maneuver allowed us to complete a subsequent RCT in 225 children following severe traumatic brain injury.Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel.

TI  - Improving blood pressure control through provider education, provider alerts, and patient education: a cluster randomized trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inadequate blood pressure control is a persistent gap in quality care.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate provider and patient interventions to improve blood pressure control.
AB  - DESIGN: Cluster randomized, controlled trial.
AB  - SETTING: 2 hospital-based and 8 community-based clinics in the Veterans Affairs Tennessee Valley Healthcare System.
AB  - PATIENTS: 1341 veterans with essential hypertension cared for by 182 providers. Eligible patients had 2 or more blood pressure measurements greater than 140/90 mm Hg in a 6-month period and were taking a single antihypertensive agent.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Providers who cared for eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive an e-mail with a Web-based link to the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) guidelines (provider education); provider education and a patient-specific hypertension computerized alert (provider education and alert); or provider education, hypertension alert, and patient education, in which patients were sent a letter advocating drug adherence, lifestyle modification, and conversations with providers (patient education).
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: Proportion of patients with a systolic blood pressure less than 140 mm Hg at 6 months; intensification of antihypertensive medication.
AB  - RESULTS: Mean baseline blood pressure was 157/83 mm Hg with no differences between groups (P = 0.105). Six-month follow-up data were available for 975 patients (73%). Patients of providers who were randomly assigned to the patient education group had better blood pressure control (138/75 mm Hg) than those in the provider education and alert or provider education alone groups (146/76 mm Hg and 145/78 mm Hg, respectively). More patients in the patient education group had a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or less compared with those in the provider education or provider education and alert groups (adjusted relative risk for the patient education group compared with the provider education alone group, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.06 to 1.62]; P = 0.012).
AB  - LIMITATIONS: Follow-up blood pressure measurements were missing for 27% of study patients. The study could not detect a mechanism by which patient education improved blood pressure control.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A multifactorial intervention including patient education improved blood pressure control compared with provider education alone.

TI  - Assessment of patients' and physicians' compliance to an ACE inhibitor treatment based on urinary N-acetyl Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro determination in the Noninsulin-Dependent Diabetes, Hypertension, Microalbuminuria, Proteinuria, Cardiovascular Events, and Ramipril (DIABHYCAR) study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess patients' and physicians' compliance with ACE inhibitor treatment, by measuring an endogenous biomarker of ACE inhibition, urinary N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (AcSDKP), in the Noninsulin-Dependent Diabetes, Hypertension, Microalbuminuria, Proteinuria, Cardiovascular Events, and Ramipril (DIABHYCAR) trial, which compared ramipril (1.25 mg o.d.) with placebo in 4,912 patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria/proteinuria.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The urine AcSDKP-to-creatinine ratio was measured blind to treatment in all participants who completed follow-up and provided spot urine samples (n = 1,871).
AB  - RESULTS: The median urinary AcSDKP-to-creatinine ratio was six times higher for ramipril than for placebo. Urinary AcSDKP-to-creatinine ratios displayed a bimodal distribution in both groups, with a very large intergroup overlap. Based on cluster analysis, we defined truly adherent ramipril patients as those with a ratio > or =4 nmol/mmol and truly adherent placebo patients as those with a ratio < 4 nmol/mmol. After excluding patients withdrawing prematurely from the study or known to have used a nonstudy ACE inhibitor, 27.3% of the 597 ramipril patients had ratios <4, indicating poor compliance, and 9.7% of the 621 placebo patients had ratios > or =4, indicating intake of a nonstudy ACE inhibitor. Correcting for compliance by using AcSDKP-guided analysis affected surrogate outcome results (decrease in systolic blood pressure and urinary albumin excretion) only slightly.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The systematic use of spot urinary AcSDKP determination facilitated the detection of defects in compliance with ACE inhibitor treatment in both patients and physicians. Urinary AcSDKP measurement could be a useful biomarker for assessing compliance with ACE inhibition in the routine care of diabetic patients.

TI  - Adherence to antihypertensive medication assessed by self-report was associated with electronic monitoring compliance.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Clinicians often find it difficult to differentiate between subobtimal adherence and nonresponse to medical treatment if a patient's clinical condition does not improve. This study aimed to evaluate an adherence self-report tool to assess adherence to blood pressure lowering medication.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Participants were 245 patients with uncontrolled hypertension from 21 general practices taking part in a randomized trial. Prior to randomization, participants were asked to indicate which of six descriptions (adherence levels) would most closely describe their medication taking and were given electronic medication monitors for 30 days. We used multivariable regression analysis to compare the adherence self-report tool with electronic monitoring.
AB  - RESULTS: There was strong evidence that a drop in one adherence level from level 1 (highest level) to level 2 and from level 2 to level 3-6 (six being the lowest) combined was associated with a decrease in timing compliance of approximately 5% (test for trend: P = 0.0004).
AB  - CONCLUSION: Adherence assessed by a brief self-report tool was associated with timing compliance obtained through electronic monitoring in patients taking blood pressure lowering medication. Further research is required to investigate the validity of this tool in patients with lower adherence levels and in a nontrial population.

TI  - Pharmaceutical care program for patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Report of a double-blind clinical trial with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharmaceutical care programs may be an option to improve blood pressure (BP) control in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of pharmaceutical care programs in treating patients with resistant hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: In a double-blind randomized clinical trial, 71 patients with uncontrolled BP were enrolled in a pharmaceutical care program or in a control group and underwent a series of cognitive tests. The primary outcome was change in ambulatory BP (ABP) between the baseline evaluation and the final visit 6 months later. The secondary outcomes were the frequency of drug-related problems and adherence as determined by plasma levels of hydrochlorothiazide.
AB  - RESULTS: The delta-values between the intervention and control groups for ABP in the different daily periods, with the corresponding 95% confidence limits, adjusted for age and baseline BP were: 3 (-1 to 5), 2 (-2 to 4), and 5 (-1 to 6) mm Hg for 24 h, daily and nightly systolic BP, respectively. The corresponding values for diastolic BP were 1 (-1 to 3), 0 (-2 to 2), and 3 (-1 to 4) mm Hg, respectively. Hydrochlorothiazide was detected in the plasma in 21 of 27 patients in the intervention group that attended to all appointments and 24 of 30 patients in the control group (P = .904).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The pharmaceutical care program tested in this trial was feasible and showed a trend for better BP control in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

TI  - Blood pressure rise with swimming versus walking in older women: the Sedentary Women Exercise Adherence Trial 2 (SWEAT 2).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Swimming is often recommended in the prevention and treatment of hypertension. Few studies have investigated the effect of swimming training on blood pressure (BP). Our objective was to evaluate 6 months of supervised moderate swimming or walking on BP in previously sedentary, normotensive, older women.
AB  - DESIGN: Women aged 50-70 years (n = 116) were randomly assigned to a supervised 6-month swimming or walking programme. They were further randomized to receive usual care or a behavioural intervention package.
AB  - METHODS: Exercise comprised 3 sessions/week with a warm-up, cool down, and 30-min of moderate intensity walking or swimming. BP was recorded for 20 min supine, and 5 min standing. Assessments were made at 0 and 6 months.
AB  - RESULTS: At baseline, mean supine BP (+/- SD) was 115.7 +/- 1.3/66.8 +/- 0.7 mmHg. Swimming improved swim distance by 78.1 m (29.3%) [95% confidence interval (CI); 66.7, 89.4] and walk time by 0.58 min (3.8%) (0.41, 0.74). Walking decreased walk time by 1.0 min (6.5%) (0.81, 1.19). After adjustment for initial BP, age, hypertension treatment status and change in weight, swimming increased supine and standing systolic BP relative to walking by 4.4 mmHg (1.2, 7.5) (P = 0.008) and 6.0 mmHg (2.6, 9.5) (P = 0.001), respectively. Supine and standing diastolic BP increased by 1.4 mmHg (-0.14, 3.0) (P = 0.07) and 1.8 mmHg (-0.02, 3.5) (P = 0.05), respectively.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Relative to moderately paced walking, regular swimming significantly elevates BP in previously sedentary, normotensive, older women. This finding may have important implications for exercise prescription in older subjects.

TI  - Improving adherence to guidelines for hypertension drug prescribing: cluster-randomized controlled trial of general versus patient-specific recommendations.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an intervention focusing clinician attention on drug choice for hypertension treatment improves concordance between drug regimens and guidelines.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Cluster-randomized controlled trial comparing an individualized intervention with a general guideline implementation in geographically diverse primary care clinics of a university-affiliated Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare system.
AB  - METHODS: Participants were 36 attending physicians and nurse practitioners (16 in the general group and 20 in the individualized group), with findings based on 4500 hypertensive patients. A general guideline implementation for all clinicians, including education about guideline-based drug recommendations and goals for adequacy of blood pressure control, was compared with addition of a printed individualized advisory sent to clinicians at each patient visit, indicating whether or not the patient's antihypertensive drug regimen was guideline concordant. We measured change from baseline to end point in the proportion of clinicians' patients whose drug therapy was guideline concordant.
AB  - RESULTS: The individualized intervention resulted in an improvement in guideline concordance more than twice that observed for the general intervention (10.9% vs 3.8%, t = 2.796, P = .008). Bootstrap analysis showed that being in the individualized group increased the odds of concordance 1.5-fold (P = .025). The proportion of patients with adequate blood pressure control increased within each study group; however, the difference between groups was not significant.
AB  - CONCLUSION: An individualized advisory regarding drug therapy for hypertension given to the clinician at each patient visit was more effective in changing clinician prescribing behavior than implementation of a general guideline.

TI  - Positive benefits of a pharmacist-managed hypertension clinic in Nigeria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether the provision of further practice-based support by pharmacists will bring about improved outcomes for blood pressure (BP) control in middle-aged and elderly Nigerian hypertensive patients managed with combination diuretics (amiloride hydrochloride 5 mg+hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg) and/or methyl dopa at the primary care level.
AB  - DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a 1-year prospective, randomized cohort study of the outpatients of a state comprehensive health centre in South-western Nigeria. Free primary health services including free drugs were provided for all patients.
AB  - PATIENTS AND METHOD: The study population comprised 51 Nigerian patients with uncomplicated hypertension aged 45 years or more, with a 0.2-3.0-year history of hypertension, registered at the Comprehensive Health Centre, Ife between October 2002 and March 2003. They were invited into the pharmacist-managed hypertension clinic and followed for the study period. Participating pharmacists counselled for current medication, personalized goals of lifestyle modification stressing weight loss and/or increased activity, increased patient awareness by providing relevant education about hypertension and associated/related diseases, adjusted drug therapy to optimize effectiveness and minimize adverse events, utilized treatment schedules that enhanced patients' adherence to therapy, and monitored treatment outcomes between enrollment and return visits. Patient satisfaction and the number of treatment failures within 6 months post enrollment were compared with retrospective data from our earlier study involving physician-managed patients under a similar setting.
AB  - RESULTS: Uncontrolled BP reduced from 92 to 36.2% by 10.15+/-5.02 days after enrollment. Treatment failures were observed at 5.9% of the total return visits (n=184) within 6 months.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Pharmacist-managed hypertension clinics can improve BP control, reduce treatment failure and increase patient satisfaction.

AB  - This study is a 3-year follow-up of a factorial randomised controlled trial of two decision aids - decision analysis and information video plus leaflet - for newly diagnosed hypertensive patients. We found no evidence of differences for either of the two decision aids compared with controls for the primary outcome of blood pressure control at follow-up. There were also no differences in any of the secondary outcomes measured - the proportion taking blood pressure lowering drugs, self-reported medication adherence, or consulting behaviour. The randomised controlled trial cohort as a whole, irrespective of randomised group, demonstrated substantial reductions in blood pressure and 10-year cardiovascular risk over the follow-up period.

TI  - Adherence to cardiovascular risk factor modification in patients with hypertension.
AB  - AIM: The effectiveness of the support of a healthcare practitioner and a family member in producing changes in cardiovascular risk factor modification was tested in a randomised, controlled trial in patients with hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: The primary outcome measured after the 24-week intervention was blood pressure change. Secondary outcomes included patients' adherence to the programme, their knowledge about hypertension, exercise capacity, body weight, self-reported ability to control stress, adherence to medication and salt restriction, as well as symptoms.
AB  - RESULTS: There were no marked improvements in blood pressure regulation in either group. The differences between the experimental and control groups were 3 mmHg (CI -6.18-12.18) for systolic blood pressure and 4 mmHg (CI -1.48-9.48) for diastolic blood pressure. The estimated blood pressure effects were small increases in both diastolic and systolic blood pressure, due to larger changes in the control group. These small changes were of no clinical significance. This intervention was not successful in reducing blood pressure of hypertensive patients who participated in a lifestyle programme. Secondary outcomes did show positive changes as a result of the given intervention. The absolute difference in improvement between the two groups was significantly greater for the experimental group than for the control group for the following variables: 24% better adherence to the programme (p = 0.007); 10% higher mean percentage score of hypertension knowledge and its management (p = 0.04); 20% more patients could control their stress levels (p = 0.05); 26% more patients could control their salt ingestion (p = 0.02); and 20% had better adherence to their given medication regimen (p = 0.05). The experimental group had a statistically significant weight reduction of 1 (+/- 4) kg relative to the control group (p = 0.03). Both groups increased their exercise capacity during the trial (p = 0.03). On the completion of the intervention, significantly fewer patients in the experimental group than in the control complained of tiredness (p = 0.05). Patients who had a 75% adherence or more to the programme were found to have maintained their knowledge and their exercise capacity, but not their weight loss after a maintenance phase of 12 weeks, during which time there was no intervention.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Patients in a supported environment such as the one in this study were able to modify their cardiovascular risk factors, even though there were non-significant changes in blood pressure reported in this study.

TI  - Use of an embedded N-of-1 trial to improve adherence and increase information from a clinical study.[Erratum appears in Contemp Clin Trials. 2006 Feb;27(1):101-2]
AB  - Withdrawal of participants from randomized trials can occur because of symptoms thought to be related to the study medicine, but the causal relationship between the study medicine and the symptoms is often unclear. Single-patient trials ("N-of-1 trials"), developed to identify optimal therapy for an individual patient in the clinical setting, may provide a means of resolving some of these dilemmas. We describe here the use of an N-of-1 study embedded within a placebo-controlled trial of saw palmetto for a participant who considered withdrawing because he believed the study medication caused an increase in his blood pressure. In this case, the N-of-1 study not only reassured the patient, who decided to remain in the study, but provided potentially useful new information regarding the study medication. Wider use of formal N-of-1 studies may be a valuable tool for improving adherence and determining whether observed side effects are caused by study medication in clinical trials.

TI  - Group versus individual academic detailing to improve the use of antihypertensive medications in primary care: a cluster-randomized controlled trial.
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare group versus individual academic detailing to increase diuretic or beta-blocker use in hypertension.
AB  - METHODS: We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial in a large health maintenance organization. Subjects (N=9820) were patients with newly treated hypertension in the year preceding the intervention (N=3692), the 9 months following the intervention (N=3556), and the second year following intervention (N=2572). We randomly allocated 3 practice sites to group detailing (N=227 prescribers), 3 to individual detailing (N=235 prescribers), and 3 to usual care (N=319 prescribers). Individual detailing entailed a physician-educator meeting individually with clinicians to address barriers to prescribing guideline-recommended medications. The group detailing intervention incorporated the same social marketing principles in small groups of clinicians.
AB  - RESULTS: In the first year following the intervention, the rates of diuretic or beta-blocker use increased by 13.2% in the group detailing practices, 12.5% in the individual detailing practices, and 6.2% in the usual care practices. As compared with usual care practices, diuretic or beta-blocker use was more likely in group detailing practices (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.40; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.11 - 1.76) and individual detailing practices (adjusted OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.95 - 1.79). Neither intervention affected blood pressure control. Two years following this single-visit intervention, there was still a trend suggesting a persistent effect of individual (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.92 - 1.62), but not group, detailing (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.80 - 1.39), as compared with usual care.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Both group and individual academic detailing improved antihypertensive prescribing over and above usual care but may require reinforcement to sustain improvements.

TI  - Introduction of diabetes passports involving both patients and professionals to improve hospital outpatient diabetes care.
AB  - AIM: To investigate whether a comprehensive strategy involving both patients and professionals, with the introduction of a diabetes passport as a key component, improves diabetes care.
AB  - METHODS: The first 150 consecutive patients who visited their internist for a diabetes check up at the internal medicine outpatient departments at each of nine Dutch general hospitals were included in this 1 year clustered, randomised, controlled trial. Health care professionals attended an educational meeting about the use and dissemination of the diabetes passport which is a patient held record. They also received aggregated feedback on baseline data and personal feedback. Educational meetings were also organised for patients. Patient files were used in conjunction with questionnaires to determine adherence rates. Data were analysed using multilevel regression analysis.
AB  - RESULTS: Small but significant changes were found in mean HbA1c levels. In the intervention group, positive health changes for patients were found (-0.3%) when compared to those in the control group (+0.2%). Diastolic blood pressure improved slightly, but no changes were found in systolic blood pressure or cholesterol. Improvements were found with regard to levels of examination of patients' feet and in patient education.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to improve professional practice involving both professionals and patients led to small improvements in HbA1c and diastolic blood pressure levels. Further study is needed to establish whether a better structured health care delivery, operating in a more supportive environment can enhance these effects.

TI  - The veterans' study to improve the control of hypertension (V-STITCH): design and methodology.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Among the 60 million Americans with hypertension, only approximately 31% have their blood pressure (BP) under control (<140/90 mm Hg). Despite the damaging impact of hypertension and the availability of evidence-based target values for BP, interventions to improve BP control have had limited success.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A randomized controlled health services intervention trial with a split-plot design is being conducted to improve BP control. This 4-year trial evaluates both a patient and a provider intervention in a primary care setting among diagnosed hypertensive veterans.
AB  - METHODS: In a cluster-randomization, 30 primary care providers in the Durham VAMC Primary Care Clinic were randomly assigned to receive the provider intervention or control. The provider intervention is a patient-specific electronically generated hypertension decision support system (DSS) delivering guideline-based recommendations to the provider at each patient's visit, designed to improve guideline-concordant therapy. For these providers, a sample of their hypertensive patients (n=588) was randomly assigned to receive a telephone-administered patient intervention or usual care. The patient intervention incorporates patients' need assessments and involves tailored behavioral and education modules to promote medication adherence and improve specific health behaviors. All modules are delivered over the telephone bi-monthly for 24 months. In this trial, the primary outcome is the proportion of patients who achieve a BP < or =140/90 mm Hg at each outpatient clinic visit over 24 months.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Despite the known risk of poor BP control, a majority of adults still do not have their BP controlled. This study is an important step in testing the effectiveness of a patient and provider intervention to improve BP control among veterans in the primary care setting.

TI  - Results of the Controlled ONset Verapamil INvestigation of Cardiovascular Endpoints (CONVINCE) trial by geographical region.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine regional differences in the Controlled ONset Verapamil INvestigation of Cardiovascular Endpoints (CONVINCE) trial.
AB  - DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, international clinical trial.
AB  - SETTING: Six hundred and sixty-one clinical centers in 15 countries.
AB  - PATIENTS: Hypertensive volunteers (n = 16,602) with > or =1 additional cardiovascular risk factor, grouped into four regions: USA (n = 8144), Canada (n = 3405), Western Europe (Spain, UK, Italy, Sweden, Germany; n = 2048) or 'other' (Bulgaria, Israel, Mexico, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Brazil; n = 2879); subgroupings included country and state/province within the USA and Canada.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Randomized to COER-verapamil or the investigator's choice of either atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide, titrated and additional drugs added as required.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Baseline characteristics; blood pressure control, medication adherence and lost-to-follow-up at 2 years; and composite primary endpoint (stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death) by regional groupings.
AB  - RESULTS: Regional differences were found at baseline for age, gender, blood pressure, percentage receiving antihypertensive drug therapy, initial choice of atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide, and risk factor profile. Blood pressure control rates increased markedly during follow-up in all regions, but varied significantly by region. Blood pressure control, medication adherence and lost-to-follow-up rates were poorest in the USA. After adjustment for baseline differences, the primary-event rate for each region was significantly lower than for the USA. Although baseline factors, blood pressure control and event rates varied by region, treatment differences did not.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Despite differences in baseline and follow-up measures across geographical regions, the absence of treatment differences by region suggests that the overall findings of CONVINCE are robust.

TI  - Nurse administered telephone intervention for blood pressure control: a patient-tailored multifactorial intervention.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A randomized controlled trial involving a nurse administered patient-tailored intervention is being conducted to improve blood pressure (BP) control.
AB  - METHODS: Veterans with hypertension from an outpatient primary care clinic completed a baseline assessment and were randomly allocated to either a nurse administered intervention or to usual care. In this ongoing study, intervention patients receive the tailored intervention bi-monthly for 2 years via telephone; the goal of the intervention is to promote adherence with medication and improve health behaviors. Patient factors targeted for intervention include perceived risk of hypertension, memory, literacy, social support, patients' relationship with their health care provider, side effects of therapy, pill refill, missed appointments, and health behaviors.
AB  - RESULTS: The sample randomized to the nurse intervention consisted of 294 veterans with hypertension (average age = 63 years; 41% African-American). A comparable sample of veterans was assigned to usual care (n = 294). We have maintained a 97% retention rate for the first 12 months of the study. The average phone call has lasted 3.7 min ranging from less than 1 to 40 min. At 6-month post-enrollment, individuals receiving the nurse intervention had a greater increase in confidence with following hypertension treatment (P < 0.007) than the usual care group.
AB  - DISCUSSION: The intervention is easily implemented and is designed to enhance adherence with prescribed hypertension regimen. The study includes both general and patient-tailored information based upon need assessment. The study design ensures internal validity as well as the ability to generalize study findings to the clinic settings.

TI  - Nurse-led adherence support in hypertension: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lack of medication adherence is a common reason for poor control of blood pressure in the community, increasing the risk of heart attacks and strokes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of nurse-led adherence support for people with uncontrolled high blood pressure compared with usual care.
AB  - METHODS: We recruited 245 women and men with uncontrolled hypertension (> or = 150/90 mmHg) from 21 general practices in Bristol, UK. Participants were randomized to receive nurse-led adherence support or usual care alone. Main outcome measures were adherence to medication ('timing compliance') and blood pressure.
AB  - RESULTS: Mean baseline timing compliance (+/- SD) was high in both the intervention (90.8 +/- 15.6%) and the control group (94.5 +/- 7.6%). There was no evidence of an effect of the intervention on timing compliance at follow-up (adjusted difference in means -1.0%; 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.1 to 3.1). There was also no difference at follow-up between the groups with regard to systolic blood pressure (-2.7 mmHg; 95% CI -7.2 to 1.8) or diastolic blood pressure (0.2 mmHg; 95% CI -1.9 to 2.3). Projected costs for the primary care sector per consultation were 6.60 pound sterling for the intervention compared with 5.08 pound sterling for usual care.
AB  - CONCLUSION: In this study, adherence to blood pressure medication was much higher than previously reported. There was no evidence of an effect of nurse-led adherence support on medication adherence or blood pressure compared with usual care. Nurse-led adherence support was also more expensive from a primary care perspective.

TI  - Comparison of the Atkins, Ornish, Weight Watchers, and Zone diets for weight loss and heart disease risk reduction: a randomized trial.
AB  - CONTEXT: The scarcity of data addressing the health effects of popular diets is an important public health concern, especially since patients and physicians are interested in using popular diets as individualized eating strategies for disease prevention.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess adherence rates and the effectiveness of 4 popular diets (Atkins, Zone, Weight Watchers, and Ornish) for weight loss and cardiac risk factor reduction.
AB  - DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A single-center randomized trial at an academic medical center in Boston, Mass, of overweight or obese (body mass index: mean, 35; range, 27-42) adults aged 22 to 72 years with known hypertension, dyslipidemia, or fasting hyperglycemia. Participants were enrolled starting July 18, 2000, and randomized to 4 popular diet groups until January 24, 2002.
AB  - INTERVENTION: A total of 160 participants were randomly assigned to either Atkins (carbohydrate restriction, n=40), Zone (macronutrient balance, n=40), Weight Watchers (calorie restriction, n=40), or Ornish (fat restriction, n=40) diet groups. After 2 months of maximum effort, participants selected their own levels of dietary adherence.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: One-year changes in baseline weight and cardiac risk factors, and self-selected dietary adherence rates per self-report.
AB  - RESULTS: Assuming no change from baseline for participants who discontinued the study, mean (SD) weight loss at 1 year was 2.1 (4.8) kg for Atkins (21 [53%] of 40 participants completed, P = .009), 3.2 (6.0) kg for Zone (26 [65%] of 40 completed, P = .002), 3.0 (4.9) kg for Weight Watchers (26 [65%] of 40 completed, P < .001), and 3.3 (7.3) kg for Ornish (20 [50%] of 40 completed, P = .007). Greater effects were observed in study completers. Each diet significantly reduced the low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio by approximately 10% (all P<.05), with no significant effects on blood pressure or glucose at 1 year. Amount of weight loss was associated with self-reported dietary adherence level (r = 0.60; P<.001) but not with diet type (r = 0.07; P = .40). For each diet, decreasing levels of total/HDL cholesterol, C-reactive protein, and insulin were significantly associated with weight loss (mean r = 0.36, 0.37, and 0.39, respectively) with no significant difference between diets (P = .48, P = .57, P = .31, respectively).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Each popular diet modestly reduced body weight and several cardiac risk factors at 1 year. Overall dietary adherence rates were low, although increased adherence was associated with greater weight loss and cardiac risk factor reductions for each diet group.

TI  - Sodium reduction for hypertension prevention in overweight adults: further results from the Trials of Hypertension Prevention Phase II.
AB  - Sodium reduction is efficacious for primary prevention of hypertension, but the feasibility of achieving this effect is unclear. The objective of the paper is detailed analyses of adherence to and effects of the sodium reduction intervention among overweight adults in the Trials of Hypertension Prevention, Phase II. Sodium reduction (comprehensive education and counselling about how to reduce sodium intake) was tested vs no dietary intervention (usual care) for 36-48 months. A total of 956 white and 203 black adults, ages 30-54 years, with diastolic blood pressure 83-89 mmHg, systolic blood pressure (SBP) <140 mmHg, and body weight 110-165% of gender-specific standard weight were included in the study. At 36 months, urinary sodium excretion was 40.4 mmol/24 h (24.4%) lower in sodium reduction compared to usual care participants (P<0.0001), but only 21% of sodium reduction participants achieved the targeted level of sodium excretion below 80 mmol/24 h. Adherence was positively related to attendance at face-to-face contacts. Net decreases in SBP at 6, 18, and 36 months of 2.9 (P<0.001), 2.0 (P<0.001), and 1.3 (P=0.02) mmHg in sodium reduction vs usual care were associated with an overall 18% lower incidence of hypertension (P=0.048); were relatively unchanged by adjustment for ethnicity, gender, age, and baseline blood pressure, BMI, and sodium excretion; and were observed in both black and white men and women. From these beneficial but modest results with highly motivated and extensively counselled individuals, sodium reduction sufficient to favourably influence the population blood pressure distribution will be difficult to achieve without food supply changes.

TI  - Pharmacist involvement in primary care improves hypertensive patient clinical outcomes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The practice of pharmaceutical care in primary care settings in Thailand is currently not generally accepted.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of pharmacist involvement in treatment with hypertensive patients in primary care settings.
AB  - METHODS: The treatment objective was to stabilize the blood pressure (BP) of hypertensive patients in accordance with the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure guidelines. Patients were randomly assigned to a pharmacist-involved group (treatment) or a group with no pharmacist involvement (control). Pre- and post-test BPs, tablet counts, lifestyle modifications, and pharmacists' recommendations were recorded. The 6-month study was carried out in Mahasarakham University pharmacy and 2 primary care units. Patients were monitored monthly by reviewing their medications and supported by providing pharmaceutical care and counseling.
AB  - RESULTS: From a total of 235 patients, the treatment group (n = 118) had a significant reduction in both systolic (S) and diastolic (D) BP compared with the 117 patients of the control group (p = 0.037, 0.027, respectively). The 158 patients (76 treatment, 82 control) with BPs >or=140/90 mm Hg at the beginning of the study showed significant BP reductions (p = 0.002 SBP, 0.008 DBP). The proportion of 158 patients whose BP became stabilized was higher in the treatment group (p = 0.017). The treatment group showed significantly better adherence (p = 0.014) and exercise control (p = 0.012) at the end of the study. Physicians accepted 42.72% of medication modifications and 5.34% of the suggestions for additional investigations.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Hypertensive patients who received pharmacist input achieved a significantly greater benefit in BP reduction, BP control, and improvement in adherence rate and lifestyle modification.

TI  - Nurse management for hypertension. A systems approach.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Standard office-based approaches to controlling hypertension show limited success. Such suboptimal hypertension control reflects in part the absence of both an infrastructure for patient education and frequent, regular blood pressure (BP) monitoring. We tested the efficacy of a physician-directed, nurse-managed, home-based system for hypertension management with standardized algorithms to modulate drug therapy, based on patients' reports of home BP.
AB  - METHODS: We randomized outpatients requiring drug therapy for hypertension according to the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) criteria to receive usual medical care only (UC, n = 76) or usual care plus nurse care management intervention (INT, n = 74) over a 6-month period.
AB  - RESULTS: Patients receiving INT achieved greater reductions in office BP values at 6 months than those receiving UC: 14.2 +/- 18.1 versus 5.7 +/- 18.7 mm Hg systolic (P < .01) and 6.5 +/- 10.0 versus 3.4 +/- 7.9 mm Hg diastolic, respectively (P < .05). At 6 months, we observed one or more changes in drug therapy in 97% of INT patients versus 43% of UC patients, and 70% of INT patients received two or more drugs versus 46% of UC. Average daily adherence to medication, measured by electronic drug event monitors, was superior among INT subjects (mean +/- SD, 80.5% +/- 23.0%) than among UC subjects (69.2 +/- 31.1%; t(113) = 2.199, P = .03). There were no significant adverse drug reactions in either group.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Telephone-mediated nurse management can successfully address many of the systems-related and patient-related issues that limit pharmacotherapeutic effectiveness for hypertension.

TI  - A multimethod quality improvement intervention to improve preventive cardiovascular care: a cluster randomized trial.[Summary for patients in Ann Intern Med. 2004 Oct 5;141(7):I53; PMID: 15466764]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research is needed to validate effective and practical strategies for improving the provision of evidence-based medicine in primary care.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a multimethod quality improvement intervention was more effective than a less intensive intervention for improving adherence to 21 quality indicators for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and stroke.
AB  - DESIGN: 2-year randomized, controlled clinical trial with the practice as the unit of randomization.
AB  - SETTING: 20 community-based family or general internal medicine practices in 14 states. All used the same electronic medical record.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: 44 physicians, 17 midlevel providers, and approximately 200 staff members; data from the electronic medical records of 87,291 patients.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: All practices received copies of practice guidelines and quarterly performance reports. Intervention practices also hosted quarterly site visits to help them adopt quality improvement approaches and participated in 2 network meetings to share "best practice" approaches.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS: The percentage of indicators at or above predefined targets and the percentage of patients who had achieved each clinical indicator.
AB  - RESULTS: Intervention practices improved 22.4 percentage points (from 11.3% to 33.7%) in the percentage of indicators at or above the target; control practices improved 16.4 percentage points (from 6.3% to 22.7%). The 6.0-percentage point absolute difference between the intervention and control group was not statistically significant (P > 0.2). Patients in intervention practices had greater improvements than those in control practices for diagnoses of hypertension (improvement difference, 15.7 percentage points [95% CI, 5.2 to 26.3 percentage points]) and blood pressure control in patients with hypertension (improvement difference, 8.0 percentage points [CI, 0.0 to 16.0 percentage points]).
AB  - LIMITATIONS: The study involved a small number of practices and lacked a pure control group.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Primary care practices that use electronic medical records and receive regular performance reports can improve their adherence to clinical practice guidelines for cardiovascular disease and stroke prevention.

TI  - Improving prescribing of antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering drugs: a method for identifying and addressing barriers to change.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We describe a simple approach we used to identify barriers and tailor an intervention to improve pharmacological management of hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia. We also report the results of a post hoc exercise and survey we carried out to evaluate our approach for identifying barriers and tailoring interventions.
AB  - METHODS: We used structured reflection, searched for other relevant trials, surveyed general practitioners and talked with physicians during pilot testing of the intervention. The post hoc exercise was carried out as focus groups of international researchers in the field of quality improvement in health care. The post hoc survey was done by telephone interviews with physicians allocated to the experimental group of a randomised trial of our multifaceted intervention.
AB  - RESULTS: A wide range of barriers was identified and several interventions were suggested through structured reflection. The survey led to some adjustments. Studying other trials and pilot testing did not lead to changes in the design of the intervention. Neither the post hoc focus groups nor the post hoc survey revealed important barriers or interventions that we had not considered or included in our tailored intervention.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A simple approach to identifying barriers to change appears to have been adequate and efficient. However, we do not know for certain what we would have gained by using more comprehensive methods and we do not know whether the resulting intervention would have been more effective if we had used other methods. The effectiveness of our multifaceted intervention is under evaluation in a randomised controlled trial.

TI  - Strategies for the introduction and implementation of a guideline for the treatment of type 2 diabetics by general practitioners (GPs) of the Lazio region of Italy (IMPLEMEG study): protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial [ISRCTN80116232].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite broad agreement on the necessity to improve quality of diabetic care through implementation of clinical guidelines, in Italy many people with diabetes still lack adequate care in general practice. In addition there is little evidence to support the choice of implementation strategies, especially in the Lazio region (central Italy), where comparative studies among general practitioners (GPs) are uncommon. The primary objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness of different strategies for the implementation of an evidence-based guideline for the management of non-complicated type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) among GPs of the Lazio region.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: Three-arm cluster-randomised trial (C-RCT). 252 GPs were randomised either to arm 1 (comprising a training module and administration of the guideline), or to arm 2 (administration of guideline without training), or to arm 3 (control arm), continuing current practice. Arm 1 participants attended a two-day course with CME credits. Data collection will be performed using current information systems. Patients' health data was also collected to describe diabetic populations cared for by GP participants. Process outcomes will be measured at the patient level and at the cluster level one year after the intervention. We will assess GPs' adherence to guideline recommendations for diabetes management relative to: 1) pharmacological management of diabetes; 2) pharmacological management of cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension and dislypidaemia); 3) measurement of glycosilated haemoglobin as the principal indicator of glycaemic control; 4) micro- and macrovascular complications assessment tests. Outcomes will be expressed as proportions of patients cared for by GPs who will have prescriptions of drugs, requests for tests and for outpatient appointment visits. To estimate the efficiency of resource use associated with the intervention a cost-effectiveness analysis will be carried out. The design of the study is based on three Cochrane and one Health Technology Assessment systematic reviews of guideline dissemination and implementation strategies.

TI  - Frequent nurse visits decrease white coat effect in stage III hypertension.
AB  - Arterial hypertension is a public health problem and patient adherence to treatment is challenging. This study tested whether frequent nurse visits provide additional benefits to antihypertensive treatment. Every 30 days, a pharmacist visited these patients to deliver antihypertensive drugs and perform a pill count. Nurses visited group A (48 patients) every 15 days and group B (52 patients) every 90 days. Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring was performed 15 and 180 days after randomization. At randomization, groups A and B had the same clinical systolic (191 +/- 5 v 186 +/- 3 mm Hg) and diastolic BP levels (122 +/- 3 v 117 +/- 4 mm Hg), respectively. After 90 days, BP declined more in group A than in group B (35 +/- 5/19 +/- 3 v 27 +/- 5/9 +/- 3 mm Hg). At 180 days, the difference increased because the reduction persisted in group A but decreased in group B (36 +/- 6/21 +/- 4 v 17 +/- 4/10 +/- 2 mm Hg). The mean ambulatory BP monitoring values were similar in both groups at 15 and 180 days. However, the attenuation of the clinic-daytime BP difference was larger in group A than in group B (systolic, -13 +/- 4 v -3 +/- 4 mm Hg; diastolic -11 +/- 3 v -4 +/- 3 mm Hg). The patients with clinic-daytime differences decreased more in group A (systolic, 16 to 10; diastolic, 20 to 14) than in group B (systolic, 19 and 20; diastolic, 22 and 22). These data indicate that frequent nurse visits significantly attenuate the white coat effect (clinic daytime BP difference).

TI  - Educational outreach in diabetes to encourage practice nurses to use primary care hypertension and hyperlipidaemia guidelines (EDEN): a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of specialist nurse delivered education in primary care to improve control of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia in patients with diabetes.
AB  - DESIGN AND SETTING: Practice-level randomized controlled trial, Salford, England.
AB  - SUBJECTS: From 44 practices, 10 303 subjects presenting in general practice with raised blood pressure (= 140/80 mmHg), raised total cholesterol (= 5.0 mmol/l) or both.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Practices were randomized to receive either the intervention for hyperlipidaemia or for hypertension; practices acted as control for the intervention not received. Specialist nurses arranged a schedule of visits with general practitioners and general practice nurses, reminding them of diabetes protocols and clinical targets. They provided educational materials and protocols used in secondary care for nurse and doctor interventions including stepping up pharmacotherapy when necessary. Practices received a list of patients in their practice who were poorly controlled at their last annual review; new and recalled patients were targeted.
AB  - OUTCOME MEASURES: At subsequent annual review, blood pressure and total cholesterol values were obtained from the Salford electronic diabetes register for patients from participating practices.
AB  - RESULTS: Overall, specialist nurse-led educational outreach to primary care was associated with no improvement in patients achieving target after 1 year-odds ratio (OR): 1.03 (95% CI 0.95-1.11; P = 0.52). Similar results were achieved with hyperlipidaemia OR: 1.04 (95% CI 0.88-1.23; P = 0.62) and hypertension OR: 1.01 (95% CI 0.80-1.27; P = 0.93).
AB  - CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that the use of specialist nurses to perform educational outreach to improve target adherence to patients with diabetes in primary care is not effective.

TI  - Treating to hypertension targets.
AB  - Control of blood pressure levels in hypertensive patients often fails to meet the targets suggested by the British Hypertension Society (BHS) guidelines. The optimal treatment target for non-diabetic patients is < or = 140/85 mm Hg. Data from the health survey for England show that in 1998 only 8% of men and 11% of women had blood pressure controlled to < 140/90 mm Hg. The Anglo-Scandinavian cardiac outcomes trial (ASCOT) data show that 87% of non-diabetic patients in the St Mary's Centre are currently treated to below 140/90 mm Hg. These differences can be explained by strict protocol adherence, a focus on cardiovascular disease, longer consultation times and punctual appointments, reinforcement of non-pharmacological advice, and blood pressure readings taken in line with BHS guidelines. Some of these points might be translated into the more challenging setting of primary care.

TI  - Randomised equivalence trial comparing three month and six month follow up of patients with hypertension by family practitioners.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare blood pressure control, satisfaction, and adherence to drug treatment in patients with treated hypertension followed up by their family physicians either every three months or every six months for three years.
AB  - DESIGN: Randomised equivalence clinical trial. Settings 50 family practices in south eastern Ontario, Canada.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: 609 patients aged 30-74 years with essential hypertension receiving drug treatment whose hypertension had been controlled for at least three months before entry into the study.
AB  - RESULTS: 302 patients were randomly assigned to follow up every three months and 307 to follow up every six months. Baseline variables in the two groups were similar. As expected, patients in the six month group had significantly fewer visits, but patients in both groups visited their doctor more frequently than their assigned interval. Mean blood pressure was similar in the groups, as was control of hypertension. Patient satisfaction and adherence to treatment were similar in the groups. About 20% of patients in each group had blood pressures that were out of control during the study.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Follow up of patients with treated essential hypertension every six months is equivalent to follow up every three months. Patient satisfaction and adherence to treatment are the same for these follow up intervals. As about 20% of patients' hypertension was out of control at any time during the study in both groups, the frequency of follow up may not the most important factor in the control of patients' hypertension by family practitioners.

TI  - Aspirin use post-acute coronary syndromes: intolerance, bleeding and discontinuation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: While aspirin's secondary prevention benefit is clear, prior reports indicate that 19-83% of eligible patients may not use aspirin chronically.
AB  - METHODS: We investigated intolerance and bleeding while on aspirin and aspirin discontinuation using 5337 post-acute coronary syndrome patients considered appropriate for chronic antiplatelet therapy who were randomly assigned to aspirin in SYMPHONY and 2nd SYMPHONY and followed for 94 (64,157) days. Multivariable logistic regression models tested associations between baseline characteristics and aspirin discontinuation and bleeding.
AB  - RESULTS: Nearly 18% of patients discontinued study aspirin; 48% subsequently used open-label aspirin and 5% other antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy. Black race, recurrent ischemia, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lighter weight, shorter time to treatment and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, diuretics, and digitalis were independently associated with early discontinuation. Early discontinuation was less likely in Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia. Although major or minor bleeding was common (12.6%), only 1.0% of aspirin-treated patients were reported to discontinue due to bleeding. Gastrointestinal (10.5%) and puncture site (7.6%) were the most common bleeding locations. Bleeding risk was associated with lower estimated creatinine clearance, shorter time to treatment, smoking, Killip class >II, higher systolic blood pressure, and use of aspirin or heparin prior to starting study aspirin.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Despite early initiation and close follow-up, more than 9% of aspirin-treated patients discontinued therapy early and remained off treatment. Addressing the factors associated with both bleeding and discontinuation during chronic therapy is necessary to improve adherence to this inexpensive, life-saving therapy.

AB  - According to Leventhal's Self-Regulatory Model of Illness, patients have ideas and action plans related to the management of their disease. The aim of this study is to examine whether ideas and action plans relating to hypertension change as a result of general practitioner's (GP's) discussing them during consultation, and whether these changed ideas and actions plans affect adherence. The study employed an experimental design, highlighting three conditions: (0) care-as-usual consultation; (1) discussing patient's ideas about their disorder; and (2) discussing patient's action plans. Ten GP-trainees performed care-as-usual consultations, were subsequently assigned to a training in either Condition 1 or 2, and performed the trained conversations. Hundred and eight patients with hypertension were consecutively assigned to the conditions, and completed questionnaires a week before, immediately after the consultation, and 1 month later. The training resulted in two new, feasible and different types of conversations that managed to affect some of the patient's ideas and action plans. It is concluded that the study provided GPs with a tool to discuss illness representations and actions plan of patients with hypertension. Implications for the management of hypertension adherence in primary care are discussed.

TI  - Measuring adherence in a hypertension clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-adherence in hypertension is a global problem and promoting adherence is necessary to decrease cardiovascular mortality.
AB  - AIMS: The purpose of this paper is to examine the measurement of adherence to medication taking in hypertensive patients. Adherence was evaluated primarily by means of MEMS (Medication Event Monitoring System, Aprex Corporation, Fremont, California) an electronic system that records the date and time of opening of the study medication container. Additional measurements such as change in urinary potassium level, capsule count, client self report and physician estimate of adherence were recorded.
AB  - METHODS: A randomised clinical trial was used to assign patients to receive the study medication (potassium) or placebo. Descriptive statistics were used to answer the research questions. Frequency and percentage of responses to different measures of adherence were carried out as well as correlation between the measures.
AB  - RESULTS: One hundred and seven subjects between the ages of 26 and 80 participated in the clinical trial. The results showed that adherence measures varied with lowest adherence from two items of self-report related to forgetfulness (46 and 55%) and stringent electronic monitoring with the MEMS (58%) to percentages in the 80-90 range for other self-report items and the general adherence scale. Electronic monitoring correlated best with capsule count at visit 5. Implications for health care providers are discussed.

TI  - Aggressive blood pressure control in general practice (ABC-GP) study: can the new targets be reached?.
AB  - Based on outcome trials, guidelines for hypertension management recommend lower blood pressure (BP) goals using an individualized treatment strategy (IND) and referral to a specialist of patients uncontrolled after 6 months of treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of General Practitioners (GPs) in reaching the recommended BP goals using the IND, or a stepwise treatment strategy (STEP) as used in the outcome trials. Trained GPs were randomized to reach the BP goals within 6 months using the IND or a STEP strategy in untreated or treated uncontrolled hypertensives. In all, 24 GPs recruited 528 patients of whom 443 were analysed (mean age 65+/-9 years, 42% men, 70% treated, STEP/IND 12/12 GPs, 231/211 patients). After 6 months, 83% of the patients had reached the diastolic BP goal, whereas only 51% the systolic (P<0.0001 for difference). Factors associated with uncontrolled systolic BP were diabetes, age >60 years and triple antihypertensive therapy at baseline. A faster BP reduction was achieved during the first 3 months using the STEP strategy, but at the cost of using more drugs (combination therapy in 68/59% for STEP/IND, P=0.06). At 6 months similar rates of control were achieved with the two strategies. In conclusion, in primary care the diastolic BP goal can be reached within 6 months in the majority of patients, whereas systolic BP remains uncontrolled in 50% of the cases. The IND should be the recommended treatment strategy, but further investigation is required on the reasons for treatment failure and the optimal strategy for its improvement.

TI  - Special intervention reduces CVD mortality for adherent participants in the multiple risk factor intervention trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient adherence affects treatment efficacy, and surprisingly, adherence is frequently associated with reductions in mortality for those receiving placebo.
AB  - METHODS: This study considers the role of trial adherence for men (N = 12,338) in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT), a prospective study of 9-year follow-up mortality following randomization to Special Intervention (SI) or Usual Care (UC). Annual visit attendance rates were used as a measure of adherence.
AB  - RESULTS: A significant Adherence x Group Assignment interaction (p =.002) revealed that SI significantly reduced cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality for highly adherent participants, RR =.91 (95% confidence interval [CI] =.84-.99) but significantly increased CVD mortality for poorly adherent participants, RR = 1.28 (95% CI = 1.05-1.57) when compared to UC. These associations remained after controlling for baseline characteristics (e.g., income), reported illness, or occurrence of a nonfatal CVD event during the trial. The beneficial effect of SI among the adherent participants was partly due to reduced smoking and diastolic blood pressure levels during the trial.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: SI significantly reduced the risk of CVD mortality for participants adherent with the MRFIT, and this effect was accounted for by positive changes in CVD risk factors. These findings suggest a method for evaluating treatment efficacy in subgroups determined by patient responses (e.g., adherence to annual assessment visits) to the treatment program after randomization.

TI  - Intensive support to improve clinical decision making in cardiovascular care: a randomised controlled trial in general practice.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of feedback reports combined with outreach visits from trained non-physicians on the clinical decision making of general practitioners (GPs) in cardiovascular care.
AB  - DESIGN: Pragmatic cluster controlled trial with randomisation of practices to support (intervention group) or no special attention (control group); analysis after 2 years.
AB  - SETTING: 124 general practices in The Netherlands.
AB  - PARTICIPANTS: 185 GPs.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Compliance rates for 12 evidence-based indicators for the management of patients with hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, angina pectoris, or heart failure. The evaluation relied on the prospective recording of patient encounters by the participating GPs.
AB  - RESULTS: The GPs reported 30 101 clinical decisions at baseline and 22 454 decisions after the intervention. A significant improvement was seen for five of the 12 indicators: assessment of risk factors in patients with hypercholesterolaemia (odds ratio 2.04; 95% CI 1.44 to 2.88) or angina pectoris (3.07; 1.08 to 8.79), provision of information and advice to patients with hypercholesterolaemia (1.58, 1.17 to 2.13) or hypertension (1.55, 1.35 to 1.77), and checking for clinical signs of deterioration in patients with heart failure (4.11, 2.17 to 7.77). Single handed practices, non-training practices, and practices with older GPs gained particular benefit from the intervention.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Intensive support from trained non-physicians can alter certain aspects of the clinical decision making of GPs in cardiovascular care. The effect is small and the strategy needs further development.

TI  - Effect of estrogen plus progestin on stroke in postmenopausal women: the Women's Health Initiative: a randomized trial.
AB  - CONTEXT: The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial of estrogen plus progestin was stopped early because of adverse effects, including an increased risk of stroke in the estrogen plus progestin group.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of estrogen plus progestin on ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke and in subgroups, and to determine whether the effect of estrogen plus progestin was modified by baseline levels of blood biomarkers.
AB  - DESIGN: Multicenter double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial involving 16 608 women aged 50 through 79 years with an average follow-up of 5.6 years. Baseline levels of blood-based markers of inflammation, thrombosis, and lipid levels were measured in the first 140 centrally confirmed stroke cases and 513 controls.
AB  - INTERVENTIONS: Participants received 0.625 mg/d of conjugated equine estrogen plus 2.5 mg/d of medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 8506) or placebo (n = 8102).
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall strokes and stroke subtype and severity were centrally adjudicated by stroke neurologists.
AB  - RESULTS: One hundred fifty-one patients (1.8%) in the estrogen plus progestin and 107 (1.3%) in the placebo groups had strokes. Overall 79.8% of strokes were ischemic. For combined ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, the intention-to-treat hazard ratio (HR) for estrogen plus progestin vs placebo was 1.31 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.68); with adjustment for adherence, the HR was 1.50 (95% CI, 1.08-2.08). The HR for ischemic stroke was 1.44 (95% CI, 1.09-1.90) and for hemorrhagic stroke, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.43-1.56). Point estimates of the HRs indicate that excess risk of all stroke was apparent in all age groups, in all categories of baseline stroke risk, and in women with and without hypertension, prior history of cardiovascular disease, use of hormones, statins, or aspirin. Other risk factors for stroke, including smoking, blood pressure, diabetes, lower use of vitamin C supplements, blood-based biomarkers of inflammation, higher white blood cell count, and higher hematocrit levels did not modify the effect of estrogen plus progestin on stroke risk.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Estrogen plus progestin increases the risk of ischemic stroke in generally healthy postmenopausal women. Excess risk for all strokes attributed to estrogen plus progestin appeared to be present in all subgroups of women examined.

TI  - Rational Prescribing in Primary Care (RaPP-trial). A randomised trial of a tailored intervention to improve prescribing of antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering drugs in general practice [ISRCTN48751230].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The underlying reasons for differences between clinical practice and systematically developed guidelines vary from one clinical problem to another. It is therefore logical to tailor strategies to support the implementation of guidelines to address identified barriers to change. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the effects of a tailored intervention to support the implementation of systematically developed guidelines for the use of antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering drugs for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.
AB  - METHODS/DESIGN: Unblinded, cluster-randomised trial. 150 general practices will be recruited from two geographical areas in Norway, and randomised to the intervention or control group (passive dissemination of guidelines). Outcomes will be measured for all eligible patients seen in the participating practices during one year after the intervention. A multifaceted intervention has been tailored to address identified barriers to change. Key components are an educational outreach visit with audit and feedback, and computerised reminders. Pharmacists will conduct the visits. During the outreach visit the main recommendations will be presented and software will be installed that links to the electronic medical record systems used in the participating practices. The software will perform an audit that will be fed back during the visit, present pop-up reminders for patients with high blood pressure or cholesterol, and provide a cardiovascular risk calculator and patient education material. The main outcomes are the proportions of 1) first time prescriptions for hypertension where thiazides are not prescribed, 2) patients not assessed for cardiovascular risk before prescribing antihypertensive or cholesterol-lowering drugs, and 3) patients treated for hypertension or high cholesterol for three months or more who have not achieved recommended treatment goals.

TI  - Effectiveness of report cards based on chart audits of residents' adherence to practice guidelines on practice performance: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical record audits have been used to provide physicians with feedback about their compliance with preventive health and disease management recommendations.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine if report cards summarizing medicine residents' preventive health and disease management practices can be used as a feedback tool to improve practice performance.
AB  - METHODS: Randomized, blinded, controlled study of 44 internal medicine residents using an individualized 78-item report card based on outpatient record audits.
AB  - RESULTS: Four hundred ninety-seven charts were retrospectively audited at baseline and 284 charts in follow-up. There were no significant differences in baseline performance between the residents in the intervention and control group. There were no differences in performance scores between residents receiving report cards and those who had not in immunizations, counseling, total preventive health, diabetes, hypertension, and total disease management.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Intensive data-based feedback using report cards may not be a successful way to improve ambulatory performance of medical house officers.

TI  - Evaluation of a pharmaceutical care program for hypertensive patients in rural Portugal.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the community pharmacist's capacity to positively influence the results of antihypertensive drug therapy through a pharmaceutical care program and to determine what factors limit the program.
AB  - DESIGN: Randomized, controlled study.
AB  - SETTING: Private pharmacy caring for a semiliterate, rural Portuguese population.
AB  - PATIENTS: Random sample of 100 patients with a diagnosis of essential hypertension who had been on drug treatment for less than 6 months. Patients were randomly assigned to an intervention (n = 50) or a control (n = 50) group.
AB  - INTERVENTION: Individualized health promotion by a research pharmacist involving monthly appointments for 6 months to monitor blood pressure; assess adherence to treatment; prevent, detect, and resolve drug-related problems (DRPs); and encourage nonpharmacologic measures for blood pressure control. Control patients received traditional care.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Control of blood pressure; decreases in systolic/diastolic blood pressure; number of detected, resolved, and prevented DRPs.
AB  - RESULTS: From the initial sample of 100 patients, 41 patients in the intervention group and 41 patients in the control group completed the longitudinal study. After 6 months, prevalence of uncontrolled blood pressure decreased by 77.4% in the intervention group (P < .0001) and by 10.3% in the control group (P = .48). Systolic blood pressure fell from a mean +/- standard deviation of 152 mm Hg +/- 23 mm Hg to 129 +/- 15 mm Hg in intervention patients and 148 +/- 16 mm Hg to 143 +/- 20 mm Hg in control patients (P < .001). Twenty-four of 29 (83%) detected actual DRPs were resolved. About 40% of potential DRPs were prevented.
AB  - CONCLUSION: In this rural community, a pharmaceutical care program was associated with significant improvements in blood pressure control in hypertensive patients.

TI  - Terminal digit preference and single-number preference in the Syst-Eur trial: influence of quality control.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Terminal digit and single-number preference may produce inaccuracy and biased results when measuring blood pressure. We describe these preferences in the Syst-Eur randomized placebo-controlled trial of the treatment of isolated systolic hypertension and describe how we sought to eliminate these problems.
AB  - METHODS: The Data Monitoring Committee of the trial conducted yearly quality control meetings in Belgium and visited the participating centres to check their adherence to the protocol. These meetings involved identifying terminal digit preference, improving blood pressure control and boosting recruitment.
AB  - RESULTS: The prevalence of use of terminal digit zero when measuring sitting systolic blood pressure (first readings) reduced from an average of 42.4% in the year prior to the date when a centre first randomized a patient to 31.5, 25, 22.3, 26.3, 23.2 and 22% in the subsequent 6 years. This trend was independent of the calendar year during which a centre entered the trial and supports the hypothesis that data-quality monitoring, including the feedback of digit preference to centres, led to a reduction in terminal digit zero preference. In addition, a higher than expected prevalence of the systolic blood pressure value of 148 mmHg was found in the active treatment groups in the double-blind phase. Selection for 148 mmHg persisted over time and constituted a single-number preference bias. This arose from the instruction to investigators to reduce systolic blood pressure to below 150 mmHg.
AB  - CONCLUSION: Monitoring and feedback of data quality should be undertaken to minimize digit and number preference. Automatic devices should ideally be employed to help to avoid these problems as long as the devices are fully validated and regularly serviced, and providing that readings are not rejected and repeated.

TI  - Improving blood pressure control in diabetes: limitations of a clinical reminder in influencing physician behavior.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hypertension should be aggressively treated, especially in diabetic patients. But studies of physician prescribing habits reveal that physicians often delay making medication changes or initiating antihypertensive therapy. A chart-based reminder was designed to improve physician medication prescribing in this clinical situation.
AB  - METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Richmond, Virginia. Patients with diabetes and hypertension were selected. A highly visible chart reminder was applied to the front of outpatient charts in the intervention group practice. A chart review was conducted to assess physician-directed medication changes. A successful outcome was defined as any antihypertensive medication increase or addition at that same visit.
AB  - RESULTS: Physicians were more likely to intensify antihypertensive medication as the blood pressure increased regardless of the reminder. Overall, only 33% of visits resulted in a medication change, even though 93% of patients had elevations over target blood pressure at the follow-up visit. Physicians in the intervention and control groups made changes to medication at similar rates (chi 2 = 0.621, p = .511).
AB  - DISCUSSION: In this study, a chart reminder failed to improve physician compliance with the clinical guideline for hypertension management in diabetics, Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on the Detection, Evaluation, Prevention and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. To inform the design of effective intervention strategies, further research should explore specific barriers to guideline adherence in this clinical situation.

TI  - The effect of n-3 fatty acids on coronary atherosclerosis: results from SCIMO, an angiographic study, background and implications.
AB  - According to the model of "response to injury," the arterial endothelium is occasionally injured in hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and in other states known as risk factors. The ensuing inflammatory response is modulated by cytokines and growth factors, among them platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). In two independent studies, we demonstrated that mRNA levels for PDGF-A and -B and for MCP-1 are reduced after ingestion of n-3 fatty acids by human volunteers. This reduction persists after monocyte stimulation/differentiation by adherence. Moreover, the reduction is brought about only by dietary n-3 fatty acids and not by other classes of unsaturated fatty acids (n-6 or n-9). This appears to be one major mechanism of action of reduced progression/increased regression of established coronary artery disease by ingestion of 1.5 g/d n-3 fatty acids, as assessed by coronary angiography in a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind intervention study in 223 patients. The study was conducted according to "Good Clinical Practice," comprehensive rules regulating investigations with pharmaceutical compounds. Together, our investigations lend support to the importance of PDGF-A, PDGF-B, and MCP-1 in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, and the beneficial role of n-3 fatty acids therein.

TI  - Comparing the efficacy of staff versus housestaff instruction in an intervention to improve hypertension management.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether a resident physician can be as effective as a faculty opinion leader in changing physicians' compliance with a hypertension practice guideline.
AB  - METHOD: At a general internal medicine clinic associated with an internal medicine residency program, sequential charts were reviewed for patients with uncontrolled or new-onset hypertension who were seen routinely during a two-week period. Subsequently, 23 providers were randomly assigned to an academic intervention to implement a hypertension practice guideline led by a single second-year resident instructor (RI), and 21 providers were assigned to the same intervention led by a single staff internist (SI) with an interest in hypertension. The intervention involved academic detailing, chart audit with feedback, and behavior reinforcement. Six weeks later, the chart audit was repeated to assess the change in practice patterns among providers taught by the RI compared with those taught by the SI.
AB  - RESULTS: Overall, management consistent with the practice guideline improved from 32% (51/157) to 45% (56/123) (p < .01) after the intervention. This change was due to improvement in the care provided by providers from the SI-led intervention: 28% (17/60) to 57% (26/46) (p < .003). Providers from the RI-led intervention showed no improvement: 35% (34/97) to 39% (30/77) (p = NS).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: This intervention was effective in improving providers' compliance with a hypertension practice guideline, but only when led by a faculty opinion leader. A resident instructor using the same format was unable to change the providers' behaviors.

TI  - Characteristics of 15,314 hypertensive patients at high coronary risk. The VALUE trial. The Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation.
AB  - Valsartan is an orally active, selective antagonist of the angiotensin II-1 (AT1) receptor developed for the treatment of hypertension. The Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation (VALUE) Trial of Cardiovascular Events in Hypertension is a double-blind, randomized prospective, parallel group study designed to compare the effects of valsartan with those of the calcium-antagonist amlodipine on the reduction of cardiac morbidity and mortality. Patients with essential hypertension, aged 50 years and older, and at particularly high risk of coronary events were enrolled. 18,119 patients were screened and 15,314 patients in 31 countries were randomized mainly between January 1998 and December 1999. These hypertensives had a mean blood pressure of 154.7/87.5 mmHg at the time of their randomization to blinded medication. The population comprises both genders (men 57.6%), Caucasians (89.1%), mean age 67.2 years, mean body mass index 28.6 kg/m2, coronary heart disease (45.8%), high cholesterol (33.0%), type 2 diabetes mellitus (31.7%) and smokers (24.0%). More than 92% of the randomized participants had been treated for high blood pressure for at least 6 months when screened for the study. The randomized population is now being treated (goal blood pressure < 140/90 mmHg) in adherence with the protocol until at least 1450 patients experience primary cardiac endpoint defined as clinically evident or aborted myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure or death caused by coronary heart disease.

TI  - The effects of postal and telephone reminders on compliance with pravastatin therapy in a national registry: results of the first myocardial infarction risk reduction program.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Noncompliance with cardiovascular therapy and prevention initiatives is well documented.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the First Myocardial Infarction (MI) Risk Reduction Program, an open-label drug registry involving mainly primary-care patients at increased risk of a first MI, was to examine the effects of postal and telephone reminders, as well as demographic and other baseline characteristics, on patient self-reported compliance with pravastatin treatment. A second objective was to determine whether regimen adherence was associated with the adoption of other lifestyle modifications recommended to decrease the risk of coronary artery disease.
AB  - METHODS: Patients with risk scores of > or = 4 on a scale of -1 to +16 for men and -1 to +17 for women on the First Heart Attack Risk Test were considered to be at increased risk of a first MI and eligible for enrollment in the registry program. An elevated total cholesterol level despite dietary interventions was an additional inclusion criterion. Patients were prospectively randomized (4:1) to either an intervention involving postal and telephone reminders (about coronary risk reduction and medication compliance), which were sent during the first 2 months of pravastatin treatment, or usual care. Both groups received reminder postcards at 4 and 5 months, in addition to counseling by physicians about coronary risk reduction. At 3 and 6 months (or study discontinuation), patients completed and mailed to the program-coordinating center questionnaires concerning compliance with care, including current use of prescribed pravastatin, as well as self-reported adoption of other lifestyle modifications, such as changing eating habits, losing weight, increasing physical activity, and/or quitting smoking. Compliance with pravastatin therapy and with these coronary risk-reducing behaviors was also assessed by physicians at the 3-month follow-up visit.
AB  - RESULTS: A total of 10,335 patients were in the intervention group, and 2765 received usual care. The 2 groups were well balanced at baseline with respect to age, race, and total cholesterol values. Neither early reminders nor baseline patient characteristics were significantly associated with reported pravastatin compliance rates, which were approximately 79% overall. However, according to self-reports at 6 months, regimen compliance was associated with the adoption of other coronary risk-reducing behaviors.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that early telephone and postal reminders do not improve compliance with drug treatment or with recommended coronary risk-reducing behaviors.

TI  - A clinic and community-based approach to hypertension control for an underserved minority population: design and methods.
AB  - This paper describes the design and methodology of the Community Hypertension Intervention Project (CHIP). CHIP is investigating the environmental and psychosocial factors related to treatment adherence and examining the effects of combining usual hypertension care with the effects of three interventions designed to improve patient compliance with treatment for high blood pressure in a high-risk, underserved minority population. Thirteen hundred and sixty-seven inner-city hypertension patients (75% black and 25% Hispanic) have agreed to participate in the 4-year longitudinal study. These participants were randomized to usual care or one of three intervention groups: individualized counseling sessions; home visits/discussion groups; or computerized appointment-tracking system. Participants are representative of the surrounding, predominantly low-income minority community and are treated in a hospital-based clinic and in a private clinic in the community. About 65% have blood pressure levels considered to be out of control. It was concluded that structural changes at the clinic site, along with the targeted interventions, would improve patient satisfaction, increase treatment adherence, and improve blood pressure control.

TI  - A design for testing interventions to improve adherence within a hypertension clinical trial.
AB  - The Potassium Adherence Clinical Trial (PACT) incorporates one randomized clinical trial within another. A randomized trial of interventions to increase adherence to medication is nested within a second randomized clinical trial testing hypotensive effect of supplemental oral potassium. The trial aims principally to compare the effects of three intervention strategies: two sessions of individual patient counseling, two telephone contacts, or standard care. The trial aims secondarily to evaluate the effect of 60 mEq supplemental oral potassium daily on sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive patients on established drug therapy. Therefore, it organizes the patients given potassium into three study groups for adherence interventions, and the patients assigned to placebo into a further three. We evaluate adherence primarily by means of the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS), an electronic system that records the date and time that the container of study medication is opened. Additional measurements, such as assessments of change in levels of urinary potassium, pill counts, appointment records, self-reporting by patients, and estimates by physician of adherence, are used and correlated with MEMS data. At a single center, the trial enrolled 107 participants between the ages of 26 and 80. This paper describes the background to this trial within a trial, details its design, documents the baseline characteristics of participants enrolled, and describes issues experienced during implementation of the trial.

TI  - Stress management intervention for primary prevention of hypertension: detailed results from Phase I of Trials of Hypertension Prevention (TOHP-I).
AB  - PURPOSE: Stress Management Intervention (SMI) was one of seven nonpharmacologic approaches evaluated in Phase I Trials of Hypertension Prevention (TOHP-I) for efficacy in lowering diastolic blood pressure (BP) in healthy men and women aged 30 to 54 years with diastolic BP 80-89 mm Hg.
AB  - METHODS: A total of 242 and 320 participants were randomized to SMI or an "assessment only" SMI Control, respectively, at four clinical centers. The SMI consisted of 37 contact hours in 21 group and two individual meetings over 18 months and included: training in four relaxation methods, techniques to reduce stress reactions, cognitive approaches, communication skills, time management, and anger management within a general problem-solving format. Standardized protocols detailed methods and timing for collecting BP, psychosocial measures, and urinary samples from both SMI and SMI Control participants.
AB  - RESULTS: In intention-to-treat analyses, although significant baseline to termination BP reductions were observed in both groups, net differences between the SMI and SMI Control groups' BP changes (mean (95% CI)) were not significant: -0.82 (-1.86, 0.22) for diastolic BP, and -0.47 (-1.96, 1.01) for systolic BP. Extensive adherence sub-group analyses found one effect: a significant 1.36 mm Hg (p = 0.01) reduction in diastolic BP relative to SMI Controls at the end of the trial for SMI participants who completed 61% or more of intervention sessions.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: While the TOHP-I SMI was acceptable to participants as evident from high levels of session completion, the absence of demonstrated BP lowering efficacy in intention-to-treat analyses suggests that the TOHP-I SMI is an unlikely candidate for primary prevention of hypertension in a general population sample similar to study participants. The isolated finding of significant diastolic BP lowering in SMI participants with higher adherence provides very weak evidence of SMI BP lowering efficacy and may be a chance finding. Whether similar or other stress management interventions can produce significant BP lowering in populations selected for higher levels of BP, stress, or intervention adherence remains to be demonstrated.

TI  - Dietary adherence in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension trial. DASH Collaborative Research Group.
AB  - Participants in controlled feeding studies must consume all study foods and abstain from all other foods. In outpatient studies in which adherence may be compromised by free-living conditions, promoting, documenting, and monitoring dietary adherence are necessary. In the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) trial, a thorough participant screening process, an orientation session, and a run-in feeding period before randomization aided in the selection of participants who would most likely adhere to the demands of the study protocol. Throughout the feeding period, various educational and motivational techniques were used to encourage DASH participants to adhere to the dietary protocol. Both objective and subjective methods documented excellent participant adherence. Daily monitoring of individual adherence was based on meal attendance, body weight measurements, and daily diaries. Urinary sodium, potassium, phosphorus, and urea nitrogen values and an anonymous poststudy survey were used to evaluate adherence at the end of the study. Most DASH participants adhered to the feeding regimen by consuming only study foods and no other foods. When adherence lapsed, participants generally cited the lack of menu variety as a reason. Successful participant adherence to the constraints of an outpatient controlled feeding study is possible with carefully selected participants and a variety of adherence-promoting strategies incorporated into the study protocol.

TI  - The dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) clinical trial: implications for lifestyle modifications in the treatment of hypertensive patients.
AB  - Lifestyle modifications, such as weight loss, sodium restriction, and limiting alcohol consumption, are important components of the initial treatment of hypertensive patients. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) study investigated the effects of dietary patterns on blood pressure in individuals with diastolic blood pressure between 80-95 mmHg. Two different dietary patterns were tested in this feeding study. A diet enriched in fruits and vegetables and a diet enriched in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products and low in total and saturated fat (combination diet) were compared with a control diet. Dietary intake was adjusted so that participants did not lose weight, and all study diets had comparable sodium intake (approximately 3 grams/day). All meals were provided for 459 participants for an 11-week period. Those randomized to the combination diet (n = 151) had a significant change in systolic (-5.5 mmHg; p < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (-3.0 mmHg; p < 0.001) after subtracting the response to the control diet (n = 154). The fruits-and-vegetables diet (n = 154) produced a significant but lesser decrease in blood pressure (systolic, -2.8 mmHg; p < 0.001 and diastolic, -1.1 mmHg; p = 0.07). Hypertensive individuals and African Americans had particularly favorable responses with blood pressure reductions, which were significantly greater than other subgroups. The combination diet was well-accepted and adherence to the diet was high (>90%) for all participants. The DASH combination diet is an effective lifestyle modification for lowering blood pressure in patients with high-normal or Stage 1 hypertension.

TI  - Implementing clinical guidelines in the treatment of hypertension in general practice.
AB  - Discrepancies between clinical guidelines and clinical practice call for practical implementation strategies. This study evaluates the implementation of clinical guidelines for hypertension in general practice with a specific computer-based clinical decision support system (CDSS) as part of the intervention. We carried out a randomized study of general practice health centres in Sor- and Nord-Trondelag counties in Norway (population 380000). A total of 17 health centres were included, with 24 doctors and 984 patients in the intervention group. Data from 887 patients was used in the analyses. There were 12 health centres with 29 doctors and 1255 patients in the control group. Data from 1127 control patients was used in the analyses. The main outcome measures were doctor's behaviour, measured by adherence to registration of recommended variables in the Norwegian clinical guidelines for hypertension. The aim of the intervention was to lower the fractions of patients without registrations. However, there were no clinically significant differences between the intervention group and the control group for fractions of patients without registration of blood pressure (intervention group 14.3%, control group 14.2%) or serum cholesterol (62.3% vs. 56.8%) during 12 months, nor, during 18 months, for fractions of patients without a registration of cigarette smoking (82.9% vs. 87.1%), cardiovascular inheritance (79.5% vs. 73.4%) and body mass index (81.5% vs. 89.2%). One or several variables necessary for calculation of risk score for myocardial infarction were missing in 91.7% of patients in the intervention group and 91.9% of patients in the control group. Large centre variations were shown for all variables. Implementation of clinical guidelines in the treatment of hypertensive patients in general practice, by means of a CDSS and several procedures for implementation did not result in clinically significant changes in the doctors' behaviour. Of importance are both the lack of user-friendliness of the specific CDSS and problems in performing time-consuming multidimensional procedures.

TI  - Characteristics of 9194 patients with left ventricular hypertrophy: the LIFE study. Losartan Intervention For Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension.
AB  - -Losartan was the first available orally administered selective antagonist of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor developed for the treatment of hypertension. The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint (LIFE) Reduction in Hypertension Study is a double-blind, prospective, parallel group study designed to compare the effects of losartan with those of the beta-blocker atenolol on the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Patients with essential hypertension, aged between 55 and 80 years, and ECG-documented left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) were included. Altogether, 9223 patients in Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, and the United States were randomized from June 1995 through April 1997, and 9194 remain after exclusion of a study center at which irregularities were discovered. This population of hypertensives (mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure, 174.4/97.8 mm Hg) with LVH comprises women (54.1%) and men, mostly retired from active work (mean age, 66.9 years), with a high prevalence of overweight (mean body mass index, 28.0 kg/m2), diabetes mellitus (12.3%), lipid disorders (18.0%), and symptoms or signs of coronary heart disease (15.1%). There were fewer current smokers (<17%) than in the general population, and approximately 7% were nonwhite. Almost 30% of participants had been untreated for at least 6 months when screened for the study. Only 1557 persons who entered the placebo run-in period of 14 days were excluded, predominantly because of sitting blood pressures above or below the predetermined range of 160-200/95-115 mm Hg and ECG-LVH criteria not met. By application of simple 12-lead ECG criteria for LVH (Cornell voltage QRS duration product formula plus Sokolow-Lyon voltage read by a core laboratory), hypertensive patients with LVH with an average 5-year coronary heart disease risk of 22.3% according to the Framingham score were identified. This population is now being treated (goal, <140/90 mm Hg) in adherence with the protocol for at least 4 years after final enrollment (ie, through April 2001) and until at least 1040 patients suffer myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of CQI teams and academic detailing: can they alter compliance with guidelines?.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The availability of clinical guidelines in isolation has generally failed to promote voluntary change in practice patterns. Accordingly, a randomized controlled trial was conducted to determine the effectiveness of academic detailing (AD) techniques and continuous quality improvement (CQI) teams in increasing compliance with national guidelines for the primary care of hypertension and depression.
AB  - METHODS: Fifteen small group practices at four Seattle primary care clinics were assigned to one of three study arms--AD alone, AD plus CQI teams, or usual care. The activity of 95 providers and 4,995 patients was monitored from August 1, 1993, through January 31, 1996. Twelve-month baseline and study periods were separated by a six-month "wash-in" period during which training sessions were held. Changes in hypertension prescribing, blood pressure control, depression recognition, use of older tricyclics, and scores on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist depression scale were examined.
AB  - RESULTS: Clinics varied considerably in their implementation of both the AD and the CQI team interventions. Across all sites, AD was associated with change in a single process measure, a decline in the percentage of depressives prescribed first-generation tricyclics (-4.7 percentage points versus control, p = 0.04). No intervention effects were demonstrated for CQI teams across all sites for either disease condition. Within the clinic independently judged most successful at implementing both change strategies, the use of CQI teams and AD in combination did increase the percentage of hypertensives adequately controlled (17.3 percentage points versus control, p = 0.03).
AB  - SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS: The AD techniques and the CQI teams evaluated were generally ineffective in improving guideline compliance and clinical outcomes regarding the primary care of hypertension and depression.

TI  - A computerized intervention to decrease the use of calcium channel blockers in hypertension.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a computer-assisted reminder would alter prescribing habits for the treatment of hypertension in accordance with current clinical guidelines in a general internal medicine clinic.
AB  - DESIGN: A randomized trial.
AB  - SETTING: The General Internal Medicine Clinic of the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle Division.
AB  - PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Clinic providers were randomized to a control group (n = 35) or intervention group (n = 36). We targeted the providers of patients being treated for hypertension with calcium channel blockers, a class of drug not recommended for initial therapy.
AB  - INTERVENTION: An automated computer query identified eligible patients and their providers. A guideline reminder was placed in the charts of patients of intervention providers; the charts of patients of control providers received no reminder.
AB  - MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During the 5-month study period, 346 patients were seen by the 36 primary care providers (staff physicians, nurse practitioners, residents, and fellows) in the intervention group, and 373 patients were seen by the 35 providers in the control group. Intervention providers changed 39 patients (11.3%) to other medications during the study period, compared with 1 patient (<1.0%) of control providers (p < .0001). For patients whose therapy was unchanged, providers noted angina in 23.1%, indications other than those for hypertension in 9.5%, intolerable adverse effects with first-line therapy in 13.9%, and inadequate control with first-line therapy in 13.9%. Of those patients without provider-indicated contraindications, 23.6% were switched from calcium channel blockers to first-line agents during the intervention period.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The use of a computerized, clinic-based intervention increased compliance with guidelines in the treatment of primary hypertension in general, and decreased the use of calcium channel blockers for the treatment of hypertension in particular.

TI  - Nutritional management of cardiovascular risk factors. A randomized clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adherence to dietary recommendations for disease management is often hindered by the complexity of incorporating them into the daily diet. Nutrition and cardiovascular scientists and food technologists collaborated to develop a prepared meal plan that meets national dietary guidelines for cardiovascular risk reduction.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical effects of this plan, which incorporates all National Academy of Sciences National Research Council recommended dietary allowances for vitamins, minerals, and macronutrients, compared with a patient-selected American Heart Association Step I and Step II diet plan.
AB  - METHODS: This multicenter, randomized, parallel-intervention trial was conducted at 10 medical centers in the United States and Canada and involved 560 men and women with hypertension, dyslipidemia, or diabetes. Following calculation of prescriptions to meet individual nutritional requirements based on the Harris-Benedict equation, participants were randomized to the Campbell's Center for Nutrition and Wellness (CCNW) plan, which is composed of prepackaged breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals provided to participants, or a nutritionist-guided American Heart Association Step I and Step II diet, in which participants self-selected foods to meet their nutrition prescription for 10 weeks.
AB  - MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood pressure (BP); lipid, glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and insulin levels; body weight; dietary intake; and quality of life.
AB  - RESULTS: Patients' BP, lipid levels, carbohydrate metabolism, weight, and quality of life (P < or = .001 for all findings except low-density lipoprotein-high-density lipoprotein ratio, P = .25) all improved on both nutrition plans. Mean differences (+/-SD) between baseline and treatment clinical values for the CCNW and the self-selected diet groups (between-group P values), respectively, were as follows: systolic BP, -6.4 +/- 9.2 mm Hg and -4.6 +/- 9.0 mm Hg (P = .02); diastolic BP, -4.2 +/- 5.7 mm Hg and -3.0 +/- 5.1 mm Hg (P = .006); cholesterol, -0.32 +/- 0.58 mmol/L and -0.27 +/- 0.56 mmol/L (-12.4 +/- 22.5 mg/dL and -10.4 +/- 21.9 mg/dL) (P = .30); glucose, -0.65 +/- 1.88 mmol/L and -0.75 +/- 2.03 mmol/L (-11.7 +/- 34.0 mg/dL and -13.5 +/- 36.6 mg/dL) (P = .10); and HbA1c, -0.4% +/- 0.8% and -0.3% +/- 0.7% (P = .66). Weight loss with the CCNW and self-selected plans, respectively, was as follows: men, -4.5 +/- 3.6 kg and -3.5 +/- 3.3 kg; and women, -4.8 +/- 3.0 kg and -2.8 +/- 2.8 kg. Quality of life was significantly improved for daily and work activities (P < .05) and nutritional health perceptions (P < .05) with the CCNW plan relative to the self-selected group. Overall nutrient intake and compliance were both significantly (P < .001) better with the CCNW plan.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Nutritionally balanced meals that meet the recommendations of national health organizations improved multiple risk factors for patients with cardiovascular disease. The CCNW plan resulted in greater clinical benefits, nutritional completeness, and compliance than the self-selected diet. The CCNW is a comprehensive nutrition plan, convenient for both prescription and practice, and appears viable for effecting favorable dietary changes in patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Appointment attendance, pill counts, and achievement of goal blood pressure in the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension Pilot Study.
AB  - The African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) Pilot Study evaluated the feasibility of conducting a 7-year clinical trial to assess the effect of two levels of blood pressure control based on mean arterial pressure (MAP) (low goal < or = 92 mm Hg or usual goal of 102-107 mm Hg) and three antihypertensive drug regimens (atenolol, amlodipine, or enalapril) as initial therapy in slowing the decline of renal function in African Americans with clinically diagnosed hypertensive nephrosclerosis. Ninety-four African American men and women between 18 and 70 years of age were randomized and followed for an average of 4.6 months. On average participants attended 87.5% of the scheduled monthly follow-up visits and achieved an acceptable level of medication adherence (80%-100% of prescribed doses by pill count) at 65.4% of those visits Blood pressure levels within goal were observed in 17.5% and 25.6% of the participants in the low- and usual MAP goal groups, respectively. Neither attendance nor medication adherence by pill count was associated with attainment of goal blood pressure. Although AASK Pilot Study participants maintained excellent attendance, their pill counts were lower than previously reported among clinical trial participants and goal blood pressure levels were difficult to achieve during the short period of follow-up.

TI  - Design and baseline characteristics of participants in the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) Pilot Study.
AB  - Hypertension and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are major causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States, especially among African Americans. The African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) Pilot Study evaluated the feasibility of conducting a long-term clinical trial to compare the effects of two levels of blood pressure control and three different antihypertensive drug regimens on the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in African Americans with clinically diagnosed hypertensive renal disease. African American men and women aged 18-70 years with a GFR of 25-70 ml/min/ 1.73m2 and hypertension were randomized in a 3 x 2 factorial design to initial treatment with either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril), a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), or a beta blocker (atenolol) and to a mean arterial blood pressure (goal MAP) of either 102-107 mm Hg or < or = 92 mm Hg. Furosemide, doxazosin, clonidine, hydralazine, and minoxidil were added sequentially until goal MAP was achieved. To compare the pathologic diagnosis with the clinical diagnosis of renal disease, study participants without contraindication were also asked to undergo a renal biopsy. The goals of the AASK Pilot Study were to evaluate recruitment techniques, adherence to prescribed antihypertensive drug regimens, ability of the antihypertensive regimens to achieve blood pressure goals, rates of participation in scheduled clinic visits and procedures, and variability of GFR measurements. A further goal was to obtain renal biopsy data in at least 75% of the randomized study participants. Compared to the ESRD patient population whose renal disease is caused by hypertension, women were underrepresented in the AASK Pilot Study. AASK Pilot Study participants had higher unemployment rates and lower income levels than African Americans in the general U.S. population.

TI  - Assessing medication adherence by pill count and electronic monitoring in the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) Pilot Study.
AB  - The Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS), an electronic monitor which records the date and time of bottle cap openings, and pill counts were used to assess patterns of adherence for the primary antihypertensive drug in the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension Pilot Study (AASK). Blacks with hypertension and moderately reduced renal function were randomized to one of two levels of blood pressure control and to one of three antihypertensive drug regimens: primary therapy with a calcium channel blocker, an angiotension converting enzyme inhibitor, or a beta-blocker. Of the 94 participants in AASK, 91 had MEMS recordings and pill counts for 313 regularly scheduled monthly follow-up visits. The average length of follow-up was 4.6 months. An acceptable level of adherence by pill count was achieved if 80% to 100% of the prescribed pills were not returned to the clinic. Adherence by MEMS to a once-a-day drug dosing schedule was acceptable if 80% of the time intervals between MEMS openings were within 24 +/- 6 h. Acceptable adherence by pill count was observed at 68% of the follow-up visits; MEMS indicated nonadherence at 47% of those visits. Blood pressure was within goal in 50% of the participants who were adherent by both pill count and MEMS throughout their follow-up visits, and only 14% of the participants who were identified nonadherent by one or both methods. These findings suggest that electronic monitoring is a useful adjunct to pill counts in assessing adherence to antihypertensive drugs. Feedback of electronically collected information on dosing intervals to participants and staff may enhance adherence.

TI  - Alpha-blockade and thiazide treatment of hypertension. A double-blind randomized trail comparing doxazosin and hydrochlorothiazide.
AB  - This trial involved 107 patients in a two-group, parallel, double-blind, randomized study comparing the diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) (dose 25 to 50 mg) and the alpha 1 antagonist, doxazosin (dose 2 to 16 mg). All randomized participants were followed for at least 1 year. Participants were recruited from the community. The study was carried out in four phases: Phase I-Baseline; Phase II-Monotherapy Titration; Phase III-Combination Therapy Titration; and Phase IV-Maintenance. The following measures were carried out: blood pressure, biochemistries, lipids/lipoproteins, quality of life, ambulatory electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, adverse experiences, and drug adherence. Both drugs were well tolerated, with only 4% taken off doxazosin and 7% off HCTZ. Adverse experiences were uncommon and mostly mild. Both drugs were effective in managing hypertension over 1 year of therapy. There was no difference noted in terms of efficacy of blood pressure lowering between the two study drugs, nor was there any evidence of tolerance developing or of any serious adverse effects. Average final doses for drugs were 7.8 mg for doxazosin and 36 mg for HCTZ. The results show that, over the course of 1 year, both drugs significantly lowered systolic and diastolic pressures compared to baseline; doxazosin (-19 and -16 mm Hg); HCTZ (-22 and 15 mm Hg). Blood pressure lowering was not significantly different between drugs. Sitting heart rate was not affected by drugs. Changes in quality of life measures were similar between groups. Echocardiographic measures at 1 year showed significant between-drug differences in change in left internal end systolic and diastolic dimensions and end systolic stress. Both doxazosin and HCTZ were effective drugs over 1 year for treating hypertension.

TI  - A telecommunications system for monitoring and counseling patients with hypertension. Impact on medication adherence and blood pressure control.
AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of automated telephone patient monitoring and counseling on patient adherence to antihypertensive medications and on blood pressure control. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in 29 greater Boston communities. The study subjects were 267 patients recruited from community sites who were >or= 60 years of age, on antihypertensive medication, with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of >or= 160 mm Hg and/or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of >or= 90 mm Hg. The study compared subjects who received usual medical care with those who used a computer-controlled telephone system in addition to their usual medical care during a period of 6 months. Weekly, subjects in the telephone group reported self-measured blood pressures, knowledge and adherence to antihypertensive medication regimens, and medication side-effects. This information was sent to their physicians regularly. The main study outcome measures were change in antihypertensive medication adherence, SBP and DBP during 6 months, satisfaction of patient users, perceived utility for physicians, and cost-effectiveness. The mean age of the study population was 76.0 years; 77% were women; 11% were black. Mean antihypertensive medication adherence improved 17.7% for telephone system users and 11.7% for controls (P = .03). Mean DBP decreased 5.2 mm Hg in users compared to 0.8 mm Hg in controls (P = .02). Among nonadherent subjects, mean DBP decreased 6.0 mm Hg for telephone users, but increased 2.8 mm Hg for controls (P = .01). For telephone system users, mean DBP decreased more if their medication adherence improved (P = .03). The majority of telephone system users were satisfied with the system. Most physicians integrated it into their practices. The system was cost-effective, especially for nonadherent patient users. Therefore, weekly use of an automated telephone system improved medication adherence and blood pressure control in hypertension patients. This system can be used to monitor patients with hypertension or with other chronic diseases, and is likely to improve health outcomes and reduce health services utilization and costs.

TI  - Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study on glycemic control and complications in type II diabetes (VA CSDM). Results of the feasibility trial. Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study in Type II Diabetes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: It is not clear whether intensive pharmacological therapy can be effectively sustained in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The relative risks and benefits of intensive insulin therapy in NIDDM are not well defined. Accordingly, we designed a feasibility study that compared standard therapy and intensive therapy in a group of NIDDM men who required insulin due to sustained hyperglycemia.
AB  - RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective trial was conducted in five medical centers in 153 men of 60 +/- 6 years of age who had a known diagnosis of diabetes for 7.8 +/- 4 years. They were randomly assigned to a standard insulin treatment group (one morning injection per day) or to an intensive therapy group designed to attain near-normal glycemia and a clinically significant separation of glycohemoglobin from the standard arm. A four-step plan was used in the intensive therapy group along with daily self-monitoring of glucose: 1) an evening insulin injection, 2) the same injection adding daytime glipizide, 3) two injections of insulin alone, and 4) multiple daily injections. Patient accrual and adherence, glycohemoglobin (HbA1c), side effects, and measurements of endpoints for a prospective long-term trial were assessed.
AB  - RESULTS: Accrual goals were met, mean follow-up time was 27 months (range 18-35 months), and patients kept 98.6% of scheduled visits. After 6 months, the mean HbA1c in the intensive therapy group was at or below 7.3% and remained 2% lower than the standard group for the duration of the trial. Most of the decrease in the mean HbA1c in the intensive group was obtained by a single injection of evening intermediate insulin, alone or with daytime glipizide. By the end of the trial, 64% of the patients had advanced to two or more injections of insulin a day, aiming for normal HbA1c. However, only a small additional fall in HbA1c was attained. Severe hypoglycemia was rare (two events per 100 patients per year) and not significantly different between the groups, nor were changes in weight, blood pressure, or plasma lipids. There were 61 new cardiovascular events in 40 patients and 10 deaths (6 due to cardiovascular causes).
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Intense stepped insulin therapy in NIDDM patients who have failed glycemic control on pharmacological therapy is effective in maintaining near-normal glycemic control for > 2 years without excessive severe hypoglycemia, weight gain, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. Cardiovascular event rates are high at this stage of NIDDM. A long-term prospective trial is needed to assess the risk-benefit ratio of intensified treatment of hyperglycemia in NIDDM patients requiring insulin.

TI  - Hypertension in Diabetes Study. III. Prospective study of therapy of hypertension in type 2 diabetic patients: efficacy of ACE inhibition and beta-blockade.
AB  - The Hypertension in Diabetes Study (HDS) is an ongoing, multicentre, prospective randomized intervention trial of therapy of hypertension (> or = 160 and/or > or = 90 mmHg) in Type 2 diabetic patients. It compares tight blood pressure control (aim: < 150/85 mmHg) versus less tight control (aim: < 180/105 mmHg) and, within the tight control group, an ACE inhibitor, captopril, versus a beta blocker, atenolol. We report the efficacy, side-effects of treatment, biochemical responses and incidence of hypoglycaemia in 755 patients (mean age 57 years, blood pressure 150/94 mmHg) followed for 2 years. At 2 years, blood pressure was 143/84 in the tight control and 156/90 mmHg in the less tight control group (p < 0.0001). Blood pressure reduction, adherence to therapy, incidence of side-effects and of hypoglycaemia were similar on captopril and on atenolol. Patients on atenolol had a greater increase in body weight (+2.3 vs +0.7 kg, p < 0.01) and a non-significant trend to a greater increase in triglyceride than patients on captopril. A large blood pressure difference between the tight control and less tight control groups was obtained, with captopril and atenolol having similar hypotensive effects. The study has the potential to determine whether strict blood pressure control reduces the incidence of diabetic complications and whether ACE inhibitor or beta-blocker therapy is clinically advantageous.

TI  - Intensified versus conventional management of gestational diabetes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that intensified management of gestational diabetes mellitus on the basis of stringent glycemic control, verified glucose data, and adherence to an established criterion for insulin initiation results in near normoglycemia control and reduction of adverse outcomes.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, population-based study compared the effect on perinatal outcome of conventional (n = 1316) and intensified (n = 1145) management. Group assignment was based on availability of memory-based reflectance meters at entry to the program. A contemporaneous randomized control group (nondiabetic, n = 4922) was selected.
AB  - RESULTS: The diabetic groups were comparable in demographic characteristics and in factors associated with higher risk for adverse pregnancy outcome, such as previous macrosomia, previous gestational diabetes mellitus, and family history of diabetes. The control group was younger, less obese, and had a lower rate of previous macrosomia. The intensified management group had rates of macrosomia, cesarean section, metabolic complications, shoulder dystocia, stillbirth, neonatal intensive care unit days, and respiratory complications lower than those in the conventional management group and comparable to those of the nondiabetic controls. Other maternal complication rates, such as for preeclampsia, chronic hypertension, and infection, were similar for the three groups. Mean blood glucose levels were a good predictor of perinatal outcome. Gestational age at delivery, previous history of macrosomia, and overall mean blood glucose levels were the only significant predictors of birth weight percentile in both diabetic groups (logistic regression).
AB  - CONCLUSION: The intensified management approach is significantly associated with enhanced perinatal outcome. This management strategy clarifies the relationship between glycemic control and neonatal outcome.

TI  - Comprehensive individualised nonpharmacological treatment programme for hypertension in physician-nurse clinics: two year follow-up.
AB  - A comprehensive programme of nonpharmacological control of hypertension (balanced nutrition, satisfactory weight, enhanced physical activity, relaxation technique, smoking cessation) by primary care physician-nurse (PN) teams who were instructed and routinely advised by a paramedical professional (PP) team (psychologist, nutritionist and physical activity instructor) was developed with the aim of increasing long-term compliance. To evaluate effectiveness, 52 mild and moderate hypertensives without target organ damage were randomly allocated to six weekly meetings of individual intensive instruction by PN teams alone, or direct group instructions by PP teams (24 and 28 patients, respectively). The respective results at 11 months and 24 months follow-up compared with baseline were: (1) 56.9% and 58.8% showed minimal satisfactory reduction of weight, (2) 49% and 58.8% showed minimal satisfactory increase in physical activity, (3) the reported increase in physical activity at 11 months follow-up was validated by significantly correlated improved performance in ergometry, (4) 75% and 40% of the patients performed relaxation vs. 2% at baseline and (5) 71% and 59% needed no medication or reduced dose to control BP, and these changes were significantly (P < 0.02) correlated with weight reduction and increased physical activity. As no differences were found between the two modes of treatment, we conclude that our programme can be successfully applied by the PN primary care teams to increase adherence to nonpharmacological measures in the control of hypertension.

TI  - Can guava fruit intake decrease blood pressure and blood lipids?.
AB  - A randomized, single-blind, controlled trial was conducted to examine the effects of guava fruit intake on BPs and blood lipids in patients with essential hypertension. Of 145 hypertensives that entered the trial, 72 patients were assigned to take a soluble fibre and a potassium-rich diet containing 0.5-1.0 kg of guava daily (group A) and 73 patients to their usual diet (group B), while salt, fat, cholesterol, caffeine and alcohol intake were similar in both groups. Mean age, mean body weight and male sex, were similar, and so were risk factors, mean BPs, mean serum sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, triglycerides, cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol in both groups. Dietary adherence to guava intake was checked by a questionnaire. After four weeks of follow-up on an increased consumption of dietary potassium and low sodium/potassium ratio, group A patients were associated with 7.5/8.5 mmHg net decrease in mean systolic and diastolic pressures compared with group B. Increased intake of soluble dietary fibre (47.8 +/- 11.5 vs. 9.5 +/- 0.85 g/day) was associated with a significant decrease in serum total cholesterol (7.9%), triglycerides (7.0%) and an insignificant increase in HDL-cholesterol (4.6%) with a mild increase in the ratio of total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol in group A patients compared with group B. It is possible that an increased consumption of guava fruit can cause a substantial reduction in BPs and blood lipids with a lack of decrease in HDL-cholesterol due to its higher potassium and soluble fibre content, respectively.

TI  - Effects of guava intake on serum total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and on systemic blood pressure.
AB  - There is evidence that inclusion of high fiber foods such as oats, fruits and vegetables in the diet can decrease fat intake and modulate blood lipids. To test this hypothesis, 61 group A and 59 group B patients with essential hypertension were administered guava fruit preferably before meals in a foods-to-eat approach rather than foods-to-restrict, in a randomized and single-blind fashion for 12 weeks. At entry into the study, mean age, male sex, mean body mass index, percentages of risk factors and mean levels of blood lipids were comparable between groups A and B. Adherence to guava consumption was assessed by questionnaires and weighing of guava intake by 24-hour recall after 12 weeks of follow-up. Nutrient intakes including saturated and total fat were significantly decreased; carbohydrates, total and soluble fiber and vitamins and mineral intakes were significantly higher in group A than in group B at 12 weeks. There was a significant net decrease in serum total cholesterol (9.9%), triglycerides (7.7%) and blood pressures (9.0/8.0 mm Hg) with a significant net increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (8.0%) after 12 weeks of guava fruit substitution in group A than in group B. By adding moderate amounts of guava fruit in the usual diet, changes in dietary fatty acids and carbohydrates may occur, providing significant amounts of soluble dietary fiber and antioxidant vitamins and minerals without any adverse effects. There is a greater decrease in lipoprotein metabolism and blood pressures.

TI  - Relation of hostility to medication adherence, symptom complaints, and blood pressure reduction in a clinical field trial of antihypertensive medication.
AB  - The impact of hostility was examined in relation to the conduct and results of a clinical field trial. Data were derived from a multi-center randomized double-blind study of the comparative effects of antihypertensive therapy (captopril, methyldopa and propranolol) on the quality of life of 620 hypertensive men. Hostility levels were higher in subjects reporting skipping medication dosages compared to those reporting they always complied with the medication schedule. Reporting of symptoms often associated with antihypertensive drug regimens was positively related to hostility scores throughout the study, even during the blinded placebo period. Persons with high hostility scores showed the greatest decline in blood pressure independent of type of antihypertensive medication. However, there was some limited evidence that hostility levels were significantly reduced by one antihypertensive medication. Overall, the present findings suggest that double-blind pharmacologic clinical trials may benefit from using reliable measures of hostility as covariates in the evaluation of symptom reports and amount of blood pressure reduction.

TI  - Effect of health education in promoting prescription refill compliance among patients with hypertension.
AB  - A multifactorial health-education program designed to enhance compliance with a once-daily regimen of atenolol was evaluated among 453 patients enrolled in health maintenance organizations (HMOs). The initiation of the 180-day study period was used to classify patients as either new or existing cases of hypertension. In turn, patients in these two categories were randomly assigned to a control or an experimental group. Patients assigned to the experimental groups received an enrollment kit upon exercising their initial prescription (new patients) or their first refill request (existing patients). The kit contained: a 30-day supply of atenolol; an educational newsletter about hypertension; information on nutrition and life-style changes; and an explanation of the intent and content of the program. Before the next scheduled prescription-refill date, each patient was contacted by telephone to inquire about his or her experience with the therapy and to stress the importance of adherence to the regimen. Each month thereafter, the newsletter and an enclosed prescription-refill reminder were mailed to each patient. The medication possession ratio, defined as the number of days' supply of atenolol obtained by a patient during the 180-day study period, was significantly (P less than or equal to 0.001) enhanced for the new and existing experimental groups relative to the control groups. Multiple regression analyses revealed that enrollment in the health-education program increased the number of days' supply of atenolol obtained by existing patients by 27 (P less than or equal to 0.001), and by new patients by 40 (P less than or equal to 0.001).

TI  - Therapeutic adherence in the elderly: transdermal clonidine compared to oral verapamil for hypertension.
AB  - This double-blind, double-dummy, randomized clinical trial, conducted in elderly patients with mild hypertension, compared adherence to treatment, efficacy, side effects, and quality of life during treatment with transdermal clonidine versus oral sustained-release verapamil (verapamil-SR). Blood pressure declined significantly--from 148/95 mm Hg at baseline to 139/84 after titration and 135/86 after maintenance--with transdermal clonidine (n = 29), and from 156/96 to 144/85 and 148/88, respectively, with verapamil-SR (n = 29). Adverse event rates and quality-of-life questionnaire responses were similar in the two treatment groups. Transdermal clonidine was worn as directed during more than 96% of patient-weeks of treatment. Compliance with the oral verapamil regimen was less consistent: Verapamil-SR was taken as directed during approximately 50% of patient-weeks of therapy, and individual compliance, assessed by tablet counts, varied from 50-120%. In all, 86% of subjects were satisfied or highly satisfied with the convenience of transdermal therapy; 87% reported that side effects were slightly or not bothersome; 65% indicated that transdermal patches were more convenient than oral therapy; and almost 60% preferred transdermal to oral therapy. In this study transdermal clonidine and oral verapamil were equally safe and effective. A substantial majority of patients preferred transdermal to oral therapy, and adherence to treatment was greater with transdermal therapy.

TI  - Risk factor changes after cessation of intervention in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial. The MRFIT Research Group.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The degree of maintenance of risk factor changes observed in post-trial follow-up of participants in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) provides insights into long-term determinants of preventive behaviors, as well as post-trial mortality differentials.
AB  - METHODS: Nine hundred eighty-nine former MRFIT participants at four clinical centers were invited to be reexamined 2-3.5 years after the end of this 6- to 8-year trial. Seventy percent came to the clinics for measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, plasma lipids and lipoproteins, serum thiocyanate, and dietary food frequency. With the addition of phone interviews, 82% provided self-report data on cigarette smoking and use of antihypertensive drugs.
AB  - RESULTS: Comparison of Special Intervention (SI) and Usual Care (UC) groups showed that differences persisted for total (6.5 mg/dl, P = 0.02) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (5.4 mg/dl, P = 0.04), and for diastolic blood pressure (1.6 mm Hg, P = 0.02). Differences were not significant for systolic blood pressure (1.8 mm Hg, P = 0.12), cigarette smoking, and serum thiocyanate. The plasma cholesterol difference represented 70% of the value at the end of intervention, and food frequency profiles were consistent with maintenance of an SI - UC difference. Loss of the SI - UC difference in smoking was attributable to both UC cessation and SI recidivism. The blood pressure difference was not attributable to different proportions of SI and UC men on medications, but possibly to differences in diuretic doses, use of multiple drugs, and adherence. There was a persisting contrast in use of specific diuretics, with more frequent use of chlorthalidone and less of hydrochlorothiazide in the SI group.
AB  - CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that cholesterol-lowering dietary changes are self-sustaining, while smoking cessation is less so, and may require continued intervention. Finally, the SI - UC differences in use of specific diuretics remains one hypothesis for explaining a portion of post-trial mortality trends.

TI  - The effect of a household partner and home urine monitoring on adherence to a sodium restricted diet.
AB  - To evaluate the effects of social support and home urine monitoring on success with dietary sodium reduction, 114 essential hypertensive adults and a household partner were recruited. One of the pair was required to be the food preparer. Patients with their partners were randomly assigned to either an active or passive partner condition. During dietary counseling in the active condition, both patient and partner were involved in instructions to change their diet to reduce their daily sodium intake to 80 mmol or less. In the passive condition, the partners were present during the dietary counseling, but no effort was made to involve them directly in the instruction or to encourage them to make personal dietary changes. Patients and active partners collected two 24-hr urine collections between each of the first two counseling sessions and received feedback on the sodium results by a telephone call. In the passive partner condition, only patients collected urine for feedback. At the end of the 6 week instructional period, all patients and partners collected a 24-hr urine and had their blood pressure assessed. Half of each group was also randomly assigned to have access to a system for periodic home-monitoring of urine for sodium content during a 3-month period beginning at week 6 of the study (immediate). The delayed feedback group received the home-monitoring three months after completion of the dietary instruction. All patients, but only active partners, used the feedback system during their assignment periods and collected a 24-hr urine monthly between 6 and 30 weeks of the study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Long-term nopharmacological treatment for mild to moderate hypertension.
AB  - Ninety-one middle-aged men and women with untreated mild hypertension were allocated to a nopharmacological treatment group or to a control group. Members of the treatment group were instructed to reduce daily sodium intake to less than 70 mmol, to reduce the intake of saturated fat, to lose weight if necessary and to perform regular physical exercise and relaxation training. Adherence to and effects of the programme on blood pressure and serum lipids were monitored for 12 months. In the treatment group, daily sodium excretion decreased to and remained at 50% of its original level (P less than 0.001), and there was a significant reduction in saturated fat intake. The average weight reduction was modest. Adherence to physical exercise and relaxation training regimens was poor. The net decreases (difference in changes between treatment and control group) in blood pressure were greatest during the first 3 months: in men the decrease in systolic blood pressure was 11.3 mmHg (P less than 0.001) and in diastolic blood pressure 8.3 mmHg (P less than 0.001); in women the decrease in systolic blood pressure was 10.8 mmHg (P less than 0.01) and in diastolic blood pressure 6.4 mmHg (P less than 0.01). However, this decrease diminished during the last 3 months to approximately one half owing to blood pressure reduction in controls. Low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased significantly in treated men and women.

TI  - Attributions for dietary failures: problems reported by participants in the Hypertension Prevention Trial.
AB  - Assigned participants in the Hypertension Prevention Trial to one of four diets for a period of 3 years: (a) weight loss, (b) reduced sodium, (c) weight loss plus reduced sodium, and (d) reduced sodium plus increased potassium. At 6-month intervals, they reported problems they were having adhering to their diets. Problem attributions were coded along the dimensions of internality, stability, and controllability and were categorized as intrapersonal or extrapersonal. Attributions were found to differ by type of diet and sex of participant. Participants assigned to weight-loss groups were significantly more likely than those assigned to non-weight-loss groups to blame themselves for their problems with adherence, making characterological as opposed to external or situational attributions. Men perceived problems to be more controllable than women. Attributions did not predict weight loss, change in urinary sodium, or change in potassium excretion.

TI  - Automated control of postoperative hypertension: a prospective, randomized multicenter study.
AB  - Hypertension after a cardiac operation is a frequent phenomenon. Complications resulting from this include bleeding, disruption of vascular suture lines, subendocardial ischemia, and possible cerebrovascular accidents. Treatment with sodium nitroprusside has become accepted practice to prevent these complications. To improve control of arterial blood pressure, a closed-loop system for sodium nitroprusside administration was developed. A prospective, randomized multicenter study was carried out postoperatively in 180 cardiac surgical patients to evaluate the performance of this system compared with manual control of infusion. Adherence of mean arterial blood pressure to +/- 10% of the target blood pressure occurred 85% of the time with the automatic system and 61% of the time with manual regulation (p less than 0.0001). With the automatic system, there was less hypertension (9% versus 22%; p less than 0.0001) and hypotension (6% versus 22%; p less than 0.0001). The superior control of hypertension was achieved more rapidly with less requirement for nurse regulation of infusion rate. The superior control of blood pressure resulted in less chest tube drainage in the automatic mode (720 mL versus 840 mL; p less than 0.05).

TI  - Enalapril versus triple-drug therapy in the treatment of renovascular hypertension.
AB  - 18 renovascular hypertensive patients were entered into a randomised, double-blind protocol to assess the safety and efficacy of enalapril (5 to 20 mg twice-daily) and hydrochlorothiazide (50 to 100 mg/day), versus triple-drug therapy employing hydrochlorothiazide (50 to 100 mg/day), timolol (10 to 30 mg twice-daily) and hydralazine (50 to 150 mg twice-daily). Specifically monitored were the effects of each drug regimen on blood pressure, plasma renin activity and angiotensin II, glomerular filtration rate by insulin clearance, and effective renal plasma flow by para-aminohippurate clearance. Results indicate that enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide was more effective than triple-drug therapy in lowering blood pressure. All patients on enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide had excellent control of blood pressure, and there were no adverse effects. In contrast, 50% of the patients on triple-drug therapy had either uncontrolled blood pressure or significant drug-related side effects. Patients who were uncontrolled or intolerant of triple-drug therapy were well controlled on enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide. Patients on enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide demonstrated stimulation of plasma renin activity with inhibition of plasma angiotensin II, indicating adherence with therapy. Therapy for both unilateral and bilateral renovascular hypertension with enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide did not result in reductions in either glomerular filtration rate or effective renal plasma flow, except in 1 patient with a functional solitary stenotic kidney. In contrast, triple-drug therapy was generally associated with modest reductions in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow, with a severe reduction in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow occurring in 1 patient with bilateral symmetrical renovascular disease. We conclude that the combination of enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide is a safer and more effective regimen, compared with triple-drug therapy, for the treatment of renovascular hypertension.

TI  - Responses of black and white males to the special intervention program of the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial.
AB  - Of the 12,866 males aged 35 to 57 years who were randomly assigned to the special intervention (SI) and usual care (UC) groups of the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT), 931 (7.2%) were black. With use of a multivariate score from the Framingham study, all were assessed to be in the upper 10% to 15% of coronary risk because of their diastolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, and/or cigarette use. Blacks in the MRFIT were of lower educational and income levels and were less often employed in professional-technical-managerial or other white-collar jobs than whites. At baseline, blacks had higher mean blood pressures and a higher prevalence of hypertension than whites, were more often smokers but smoked fewer cigarettes per day, and had a higher prevalence of ECG abnormalities. Dietary lipid composition was similar for black and white males; so also were weight and body mass index, plasma total cholesterol levels, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were higher and triglyceride levels lower for blacks than whites. Attendance rates over the years of the trial were similarly high for blacks and whites. Among males in the SI group, smoking cessation rates, changes in dietary lipid composition and in plasma total and LDL cholesterol, and achievement of normotensive diastolic pressure with antihypertensive stepped-care treatment were comparable for black and white males. This MRFIT experience indicates ability to induce extensive changes in life-styles (eating and smoking habits) of both black and white American males of varying educational and socioeconomic backgrounds and also to achieve long-term effective adherence to programs for the treatment and control of hypertension.

TI  - Screening, treatment and adherence to treatment for hypertension.
AB  - The population aged 40 to 64 years of the municipality of Koylio, situated in southwestern Finland, was screened for hypertension in 1973-74; a total of 1018 persons (92%) participated in the program. On the basis of two separate blood pressure measurements a total of 147 hypertensive individuals who were not under treatment were identified. These individuals were divided into two groups by randomization of matched pairs. One group (the control group) was merely advised by letter to see a physician for raised blood pressure, while the other group (the experimental group), in addition to being so notified, received written information explaining the nature of hypertension and the importance of its treatment. After two years, the individuals in both groups were invited for a follow-up blood-pressure measurement, with the object of investigating the number of individuals who had sought treatment and who had continued it, and the differences between the groups in treatment seeking and adherence. A total of 79% of those who were notified to seek medical care had done so. Antihypertensive drug therapy had been begun for 85% of these. After two years, 56% of those who had been found initially to be hypertensive and who were seen in the follow-up were still under treatment. In 43% of these the blood pressure was at the target level. No statistically significant differences in treatment seeking and adherence to it were found between the experimental and control groups, nor were differences found in the decline in the blood pressure or its target levels. Comparing with other studies shows, that results can be better if the health care system that carries out the screening procedure for hypertension also take active steps to bring the patient under treatment and keep him on the regimen.

TI  - Improving compliance among hypertensives: a triage criterion with cost-benefit implications.
AB  - Triage method based upon individual patient characteristics is developed to determine the most effective health education interventions for hypertensive patients. The sample included 402 patients randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. The efficacy of a triage process, whereby patients are subdivided into groups that are more predisposed to benefit from a given health education approach, is discussed. From a limited cost-benefit evaluation, it appears that the benefits of the triage method for achieving medication compliance clearly outweigh its costs only in the case of the highly depressed patients (24 per cent of the sample). Different levels of depression were found to be differentially responsive to different health education treatments for achieving adherence to medication. The most depressed patients were more responsive to family member reinforcement, a 156 per cent increase in the number of high compliers as compared to no intervention.

TI  - Correlates of attendance and compliance in the hypertension detection and follow-up program.
AB  - The Hypertension Detection and Follow-Up Program (HDFP) screened 159,000 individuals aged 30-69 years in 14 communities. Using a two-stage process, 10,940 hypertensives were randomized into two treatment groups. The first group was referred to community sources for care (RC), and the second received free Stepped Care (SC) treatment with extensive efforts to reduce the barriers to care. One year after enrollment, attendance showed 85% of SC participants active (white males 88%, white females 84%, black males 83%, and black females 84%). One year attendance rates ranged from a low of 84% for those with baseline DBP 90-104 mm Hg to a high of 90% for those with baseline DBP greater than or equal to 115 mm Hg. There was no apparent association with age, however, attendance exhibited a positive relationship with education, ranging from 83% for those completing less than high school to 94% for those with degrees beyond college. Life tables analyses demonstrated that race, sex, and blood pressure level compliance differences manifest themselves at the early stages of enrollment with little variation among participants once in the program. Pill counts correlated with percent with controlled blood pressure as well as serum potassium and calcium levels. Educational level was also a major predictor of drug adherence ranging from 74.7% to 89.7% (from under 7th grade to above college) having taken greater than or equal to 80% of their pills.

TI  - A test of interventions to increase adherence to hypertensive medical regimens.
AB  - Low rates of adherence to hypertensive therapy limit patients' securing the full benefits of treatment. While some factors related to adherence have been identified research on the effectiveness of interventions to increase adherence levels is sparse. The present study was designed to assess the impact of a series of different interventions on a group of some 400 patients, all under the care of private physicians in a small community. A factorial design was employed to deliver four, sequential educational interventions, about four months apart, to randomly selected sub-groups. Interviews before and after each intervention provided information concerning self-reported adherence, health status, health beliefs, and personal characteristics. Pertinent medical records and pharmacy data were also obtained. The first intervention - printed material - did not significantly affect adherence. The second and fourth interventions - nurse telephone calls and social support - each increased medication taking and the third intervention - self-monitoring - led to better weight control. There was no cumulative impact of the interventions and different aspects of regimens were not significantly related to one another.

TI  - Influencing adherence among hypertensives.
AB  - In the treatment of hypertension, problems of nonadherence and consequent poor blood pressure control are particularly severe. Alternative intervention strategies were compared to explore means of improving adherence and lowering blood pressures. In a 3 x 4 repeated measures analysis of variance design, 115 patients were randomly selected and randomly assigned to one of three treatment modalities (routine clinic care, patient education, and contingency contracting) and were followed over four clinic visits. Subjects' knowledge about hypertension and its management, adherence to requests for regular medical follow-up, and blood pressure levels were measured. Patient education was not effective in lowering blood pressures; it produced an untoward outcome, a dropout rate higher than that for patients receiving only routine clinic care. However, contingency contracting was an effective intervention strategy for improving patient knowledge, F (1,59) = 51.32, p less than .0001; adherence to requests for regular medical care, Max L (2) = 25.9, p less than .0001; and decreasing diastolic blood pressures, F (2,49) = 3.39, p less than .05.

TI  - Initial knowledge and attitudes as predictors of intervention effects: the individual management plan.
AB  - This paper addresses questions concerning the effects of patient education strategies to increase adherence to antihypertensive medical regimens. It endeavors to fill gaps in our knowledge about intervention effects that may link research findings with health care applications. Data from a community intervention study of 432 hypertensives are used to address two broad questions relating research on patient education to health care practice: Do interventions have different effects on individuals who differ with respect to initial attitudes or knowledge, and to what extent do interventions produce changes in the factors thought to mediate their effects on behavior? This investigation tests a client-oriented approach to the delivery of interventions, the Individual Management Plan (IMP). The IMP approach is based on the hypothesis that interventions will be differentially effective for individuals with varying levels of initial attitudes and knowledge thought to mediate the effects of the interventions on behavior. Analysis of variance, correlational analyses, and analysis of covariance models are used to test various aspects of this hypothesis. Analyses are performed for adherence to medication regimens, dietary sodium restrictions, and weight-loss recommendations. The results of analyses offer only minimal support for the IMP hypothesis. The state of the art and constraining factors in the study are examined to guide future applications of the IMP approach.

TI  - Aspirin in coronary heart disease. The Coronary Drug Project Research Group.
AB  - The Coronary Drug Project Aspirin Study (CDPA), started in late 1972 and terminated in early 1974, involved men selected from three groups originally receiving dextrothyroxine or estrogen therapy in the Coronary Drug Project. All patients had a history of myocardial infarction, most of them several years earlier. Length of follow-up ranged from 10-28 months (average 22 months). A total of 1529 patients were recruited and were randomly assigned on a double-blind basis to aspirin therapy -- one 324-mg tablet three times daily or a corresponding placebo treatment. Data indicate a high level of adherence to the study protocol. No major differences were recorded in use of nonstudy medications in the two treatment groups. Overall mortality was 5.8% in the aspirin group and 8.3% in the placebo group (an observed difference of 30%). This difference, suggestive of a beneficial effect for aspirin in the treatment of post-myocardial infarction men, was not large enough to be conclusive.

TI  - A hypertension control program based on the workplace. Report on the Chicago Center.
AB  - In several large Chicago companies and institutions, workplace screening of 7,151 persons yielded 833 suspect hypertensives. Of these, 91% attended a follow-up verification visit, where for 513 persons high diastolic pressure was confirmed. One-half of these persons were referred to their physicians for treatment and one-half were randomly assigned to be treated directly by HDFP, in a step-wise pharmacologic regimen to normalize diastolic pressure. Of the 257 persons assigned to program treatment, 94% accepted such treatment, and over 90% of these still living in the community were active participants at one year. Average diastolic pressure of these active participants was 83.1 mm Hg at one year, compared to 102.6 at first screen and 98.8 at the second confirmatory screening. A strenuous effort has been made to reduce or eliminate obstacles to treatment, including lack of understanding of the need for long-term therapy, cost barriers and barriers of inconvenience of treatment. The medical team conducting the program combined physicians with nonphysician therapist-health counselors, plus "outreach" staff, to maximize program adherence. Preliminary experiences in the Chicago Center of the Hypertension Detection and Follow-Up Program (HDFP) give encouraging evidence that the workplace is a useful base for successful hypertension control efforts.

TI  - Hypertension treated by salt restriction.
AB  - 31 patients with a diastolic blood-pressure between 95 and 109 mm Hg have been treated for two years with a regimen involving a moderate restriction of salt in the diet. The results are compared with those in a control group and in a drug-treated group. Salt restriction has reduced the diastolic blood-pressure by 7.3+/-1.6 mm Hg, a result similar to that in patients treated with antihypertensive drugs. In the untreated group the diastolic blood-pressure rose by 1.8+/-1.1 mm Hg. Most patients did not achieve the desired amount of salt restriction and a stricter adherence to the diet might have caused further falls in blood-pressure. Excessive salt intake is probably a major cause of the epidemic of hypertension in "civilised" countries and a reduction in salt intake may help to control the epidemic. In persons with a diastolic blood-pressure between 90 and 105 mm Hg salt restriction should be tried before drugs.
